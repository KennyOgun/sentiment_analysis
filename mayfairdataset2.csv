R2PALAAI6TFDFA,"Pros:
* Easy installation.
* Good spray quality from both the overhead and handheld shower heads.
* Affordable price.
Cons:
* Flimsy construction.
* Difficult to tighten moving parts.
* Initial leakage at the pipe connection (required additional tape to fix).
Overall: This rain shower head is a good value for those on a budget. The spray is enjoyable, and installation is simple. However, be prepared for potential leakage and a slightly less robust build. If you need a cheap rain shower head, it gets the job done.",3,2025-03-25,United States
R3L6U6PSXIYTIR,"The first few times using it the stream is awesome!! It comes out just like a rain shower. After though, the jets get clogged. We have a full house water filtration and purification system and it doesn’t create hard water. So, not sure where the issue lies at.",3,2025-03-21,United States
R3MVC57KX3HJ26,"It works great without restrictor but the holder for the smaller head , isnt very good , it slips off slamming onto the tub , it is annoying but the main head I'm happy with and installed so I'm ot returning but being more cautious about that next buy",3,2025-04-08,United States
R3UYPWQEV6JHRS,"Got here quick, easy and convenient to install. The WAND is high pressure, the main shower head is a low pressure rain style. Not what I wanted, misleading title and description. It works, doesn't leak, so you get 3/5 stars.",3,2025-03-26,United States
R3DUI9YX2553QI,Es una buena regadera al principio pero al poco tiempo deja de salir el agua de la shower head grande. Cosa que nunca me había pasado con ninguna regadera.,3,2025-04-01,United States
R10584NPJGT9HO,"I’m guessing it is probably due to the size of flow, the amount of holes, but the pressure isn’t very good",3,2025-04-07,United States
RDY7RXF2OK8LV,"Easy to install, looks great, and instant upgrade to the bathroom decor. It has great water pressure from each option by themselves. However, when using it in combo mode, the water pressure is non existent. This is due to the water flow actuater installed that restricts the flow to 1.8 gallons per minute. I returned after discovering this flaw.",3,2025-03-01,United States
RTDBDWV4FPZ09,"Shower head was great.... for about a month, then a constant drip. Product returned.",3,2025-03-26,United States
R335G1643A12CJ,"Overall, it’s a nice shower head for the price. I was very underwhelmed with the pressure from the rainfall shower head though. I don’t think it’s my water pressure in general because the handlheld shower head works great. The whole thing was fairly easy to install, took me about 20 min by myself. I got it together with no leaks on the first try. The only thing I would change is the water pressure coming from the rainfall portion.",3,2025-03-09,United States
R3CR7PXIMK75L1,Works ok. But immediately started spraying in weird directions not straight.,3,2025-04-01,United States
R1DL009W7BWM2R,"Tried to save a couple bucks because of the water in my area shower heads go bad in about a year, liked the shower setup but it is cheap so spend a little more and get the bigger one with the adjustment and it’s made to last a little longer",3,2025-02-07,United States
R17BYZUT1R1BV0,It’s been only 1.5 months since I started to use the product and it’s been already giving malfunctions. Some holes are not throwing water or drips only. I don’t think it’s useful .,3,2025-02-16,United States
R11KTT9EIRZPVP,"It was extremely easy to install, I did it by myself in 10 minutes and I'm not even that handy. Looks nice and easy to clean. Switching between different modes is easy to use, and the pressure is great for both the handheld and the shower head.
However, a huge issue for me is that less than a year later only 1/3 of the little holes in the rainfall shower head are working as intended. Some of them don't have water coming out at all and some of them spray the water every which way. I don't wash my hair every day and would like to keep it dry while I'm washing my face. This 360 water spraying leaves me and the whole area around the shower soaked. I clean my shower and the shower head regularly and never had such an issue with a rainfall type of installation before. I tried cleaning the holes with a toothpick and a brush but nothing seems to have any effect. So the only solution is to replace the whole thing, which I will do, but not with this brand.",2,2025-03-11,United States
R1EVAB7HR23PQV,"I’m speaking only on water pressure here. I came looking for any shower head that would dump the most water. Couldn’t find anything that anyone said was above the rest, and this one was a best seller that said high pressure so I tried it. The water fall is about a 3/10 and the hand held head is about a 6/10 which is still worse than the old one I had. The multiple settings is cool, it switches between the over head and the hand held really smoothly. Quality product, but go elsewhere if you want some power!",3,2024-12-25,United States
R4Z0RV8KDJU2L,It is a little small to be considered a rain shower head. But the shower extension is a nice addition.,3,2025-02-27,United States
R2Q5CWX2YNP8ER,No Content,3,2025-04-02,United States
R14NTUHCH4LSTS,"This showerhead came nicely packed and I had high hopes for it because of the great reviews but it is supposed to have 3 settings- showerhead only, showerhead and handheld and handheld only. When I set it to the middle setting for both the showerhead and handheld- the handheld has no pressure so when I set it to the showerhead only- the handheld leaks the entire time. I will be returning and am very sad about it because it is a nice looking showerhead.",3,2024-12-29,United States
RZTYM1LW14BZ8,"Overall I believe the quality and power of this shower head is pretty good. I love the rainfall and the hand held wand has strong pressure in different settings form. The wall stick was very secure however I don’t like the base for the wand, it’d be nice if it had more of a securement feature. Not just placed there to fall and get knocked down. Thats the reasoning of not 5 stars.

It would be nice if the rainfall head had some different spray features as well.",3,2025-01-23,United States
R2D4LVHF5GX3AX,It's beautiful and easy to put together.. I just wish there was better water pressure,3,2025-03-20,United States
R12DZM6GKICEZJ,The handheld wand has more water pressure than the big shower head! I'm disappointed!,3,2025-02-20,United States
RHY5S27D83U45,"Do yourself a favor and don’t gamble your time and money save yourself the headache and buy a brand that you know will work. I’ve gone through to of these now and they both have the same leaking issues from the same area in the coupling. I gave the benefit of the doubt on the first one and went ahead with the replacement option finally get some time to install it and they’re both leaking from the exact same “loose” area that allows the arm to pivot and from an engineering standpoint that is the worst ideas when it comes to fluids. Needless to say instead of the two nozzle option I get a complimentary 3 jet that spews like a geyser from an area that should be water tight. With that being said if I took some precious time out of my meager existence I could probably fix it but I’m not purely because I bought this with the intention of having a plug and play shower head and go about my life. Now please excuse me while I go and reattach my old shower head that doesn’t leak because it’s not an entire da Vinci mechanism just to hose myself off…

Edit & UPDATE***: Customer service rep contacted shortly after I left my review. They where extremely concerned with my personal qualm aswell the quality of the product they where distributing. In my personal humble opinion customer CS reaching out to me in a very professional and timely manner means more to me than a faulty piece of equipment. They went above and beyond fixing the the situation and I’m very grateful for their sincerity. With that I changed my original rating from a 1 star to a 3 star regarding their professional and timely customer satisfaction concern for their product quality.",3,2024-01-06,United States
RLGGZWW8WMDKP,No cae con presión el agua como se esperaba,3,2025-03-11,United States
R3R6PWZ2UJARB8,Feels awesome but uses up hot water VERY quickly,3,2025-02-28,United States
R2MUUCT9T9UAX9,I love the overhead rainfall feature it’s very relaxing but you can’t use both overhead and handheld at the same time because the water pressure drops significantly. I figured the handheld would have tons more pressure than the overhead but it’s not too much of a difference. Not a bad buy but I wouldn’t consider it high pressure at all,3,2025-01-04,United States
R37SCUGUN22I6Y,great but smaller than I thought,3,2025-02-28,United States
R7MJDZHJ8LITK,It is very stylish and affordable.,3,2025-03-17,United States
R3PZX95QP0XI5O,"UPDATED REVIEW:
After posting my review I was contacted by the seller and offered apologies and a full refund. It is refreshing to know there are still good sellers on-line. Although this item did not meet my expectations, I certainly recommend the seller.

ORIGINAL:
Looks nice, but not the quality I expected.
Very low water pressure and joints are flimsy.",3,2025-01-23,United States
R3U8GNLNFGS4TM,"I was very excited about this rain shower head with an extension arm. It was very easy to install, looks sleek, and it did not leak. Unfortunately, however, the pressure from the rain shower is barely there, such that using both the arm extension and rainfall at the same time is not realistic. That is without even using the pressure regulator that comes included if you need it. The arm extension has more pressure although not an impressive amount as my older shower head. The function options are also quite limited. Something odd in my experience with this shower is that I had to set the water to a much hotter setting for it to feel like the temperature that I normally use as compared to my previous shower head. This effect is even more pronounced with the arm extension, probably because of the long hose that gives the water a chance to cool down as it flows.

My bathroom is far from the water heater, and although I have never had an issue with other shower heads, this one seems to struggle with temperature regulation and driving water pressure. I think these experiences probably depend on the layout of your house, how much pressure you get, and how far you are from your water heater. It just did not work out for me.",3,2024-05-12,United States
R1S3SOY4Y3JEMN,I like it and it seems to be made well but it really lacks water pressure. We have great water pressure at our house but this makes it seems like we don't. I'll probably end up replacing just the shower head part with something else.,3,2025-01-29,United States
R3CDIORGJ3DEUA,shower head is average pressure don't be fooled by ratings . Just like any other shower head hook-up on market . listen it's all cap . our country is full of lies and company's are allowed to lie to us to make profit.,3,2025-01-03,United States
R1RAO9BD6KXVYT,The rain head isnt high flow what so ever but its nice enough for the price. The water flow won't get any soap out of your hair but that's what the hand holds for. The hand holds flow is really good and actually gets rid of all the conditoner and soap but it has a horrendous bracket that's annoying to deal with. Wish they made it so that it would actually stay in place but this is what you get for this price range. Really like being able to pause the water on handheld mode so I'll keep it but will be looking for a better bracket to keep it in place.,3,2024-12-06,United States
R22Q1LN48TRFGD,"Easy to install and works great! However, 5 months later, the water coming from the handheld piece still strongly smells of chemicals for about 10 seconds every time it’s used",3,2025-01-17,United States
R19OBFHYH9J1WE,Easy install. Valve in the handheld (the button) leaks by when not button is not pressed. Minor annoyance but it’s a cheap Amazon shower head.,3,2025-01-14,United States
R1L3EPRSC9QVI6,"I ordered Veken high-pressure rain showers last week, but I'm having an issue with the wall bracket, which failed the next day.",3,2025-01-28,United States
R1UR16QRIPC9TH,The pressure in the shower head isn't great but the pressure from the handheld is pretty good.,3,2025-02-12,United States
R2LAS31T99QN9T,"This seems like a well-built shower head. However, the controls to turn off the handheld or the main shower head aren't adequate",3,2025-01-22,United States
R1QRS5YQPCW11,Very poor streem on the big head. NOT recommended. The hand nozzel work good.,3,2025-02-10,United States
R1X46IXJQUMNA2,I was super excited to try this but was left disappointed. The rainfall head does not have enough pressure and I'm left feeling cold in the shower. I really like the handheld attachment and it's various modes but we unfortunately installed it too low before realizing we wouldn't like the main head. The heads are made of plastic and seem like they will hold up but could break easily too. Install was easy.,3,2024-12-19,United States
R3IHR623U56DX7,Misleading not good pressure,3,2025-02-12,United States
R2HPBBQBTRYR1Q,"Head work as a shower should be .
But bad Design for holder the small head. Stick to the wall ?? Naaaa that didn't work . Had to construct glue to the tile . Product needs redesigned . Can't believe that was the choice design . Whaoooo.",3,2024-12-19,United States
R2EJWO5ZDPEI9L,"I purchased this product looking for a more spa like shower experience with a relaxing rain shower; however, I didn’t really get rain. What I got was a drizzle. There’s hardly any water pressure in the rain water shower head which is a big bummer. The hand held option has more water pressure and is a better option, but doesn’t offer that spa like experience. I felt like I was being beat to death by water. I am rating this with two stars because it was easy to install.",2,2025-03-31,United States
R3FVUEOX6O73XT,"The showerhead and extension functionality are great, but the extension holder gets pulled off my shower wall by the extension after an hour or so. I tried multiple times but I don't see how to remedy this.",3,2024-12-19,United States
R2M4XS8LBCJ5L4,"This would probably work fine, but the problem is that the place to switch from shower to handheld is at the top of the pipe. I would have to get a stool to reach, and that’s not convenient.",3,2025-01-01,United States
R2VQN83SUJIKOZ,"As others have said, the water pressure is not that great. I had great water pressure before, but with this it is not so strong. It is good enough. I've notice that some of the holes work, then don't work, then work again. I recently fell and fractured some bones, so I cannot take it off to research what is wrong. I would not buy this again, but the price is low. If it lasts 6-12 months I'll figure I got my money's worth. I do like that you can have both heads spraying, not strong, or one spray which is obviously stronger. Next time, I'll purchase a name brand.",3,2024-09-28,United States
R3UE6WIJZVBWXJ,Works fine. Easy to install. The wand doesn't have as good of water pressure as the one I had before. It's also plastic.,3,2024-12-22,United States
R39DLDROSCO8BZ,"Doesn’t really hold enough pressure to use both simultaneously that well. Additionally, the most function doesn’t work. It’s a great showerhead overall though.",3,2024-12-26,United States
RO9C2SLSWYHR1,Water pressure is ok. Wand has more pressure then the head. Dont think id buy it again,3,2025-01-05,United States
R1V47WEC7ZR7DA,i dislike how the rainfall (the bigger shower head) doesn't have any other flow setting.,3,2025-01-06,United States
R1GJMIU4LV2FFU,"I actually really liked the look, quality and the ease of installation. I have VERY high water pressure so I was really excited about this product. I think it’s just how large the diameter is but it just trickles out with next to no pressure. The handheld sprayer had OK pressure but not nearly as much as the basic 2-3” head I had on there previously. I will look for something smaller in diameter next.",3,2024-10-21,United States
RD5KDBVAZ7GNR,"Absolutely love the water pressure, quality of shower heads and hose, was super easy to assemble with very clear directions! Only down fall is the adhesive on the handheld shower wall mount is unreliable. Cleaned the shower wall, dried it with a fresh towel and the mount fell off after 2 showers within 12 hours. The weight bent the handheld wall mount as it fell and now between the lack of adhesive and bent thin material, it can no longer adhere to our shower wall let alone hold the handheld shower head. I’m so bummed because I love this shower head! Will hope I can find a replacement handheld mount at Home Depot. This adhesive reminds of a slightly stickier version of a standard peel and stick sticker. The shower head itself is a dream & well worth the cost! The handheld mount in my opinion, from this experience, would benefit from a little upgrade. Otherwise I enjoy the luxury feeling this shower head provides!",3,2024-04-06,United States
RPTVQLKLKIE34,It works that's it,3,2024-12-31,United States
R2RHO2X7GG2IWP,The part that holds the extra shower handle fell off after one day of use. We made sure to clean the shower and wait for it to be dry. And we also waited 24 hrs before using this shower to ensure the adhesive sticks. We just wanted to adjust the shower head and when we moved it downwards the entire thing came off and now it won't even stick anymore. So disappointing. The pic is how my moms shower looks until we can figure something else out.,2,2025-02-16,United States
R26XOJ2JLXENWC,"Installed easily, looks sharp, high pressure with the lightweight, aluminum feeling detachable showerhead. but 4 months later the larger shower head weakened in pressure and seemed clogged. Ended up taking it down and going back to my original shower head. That worked fine.",2,2025-03-28,United States
R2YF6TFWTEY72J,"Bought this shower head after our other one broke. Seemed good. I've noticed that this one will drip from the shower head and the extension arm for such a long time after a shower. Our previous one did not drip and it's incredibly annoying. Wish the shower head itself was more square, the pressure off the arm isn't the greatest. Should have researched more before buying, unfortunately when you're in a bind, you buy the best for your budget at the time and pay for it later.",3,2024-08-15,United States
R1Z5BTLS4HL4VN,I was really excited about this shower head but I was disappointed. The water only came out of half the shower head and even then its just barley coming out it's not high pressured at all. Nothing is clogged either. Also the part that sticks on the wall to hold the other smaller shower head doesn't come off which is a good thing but sucks when you are moving and can't take that with to hold your shower head in place.,3,2024-09-04,United States
R2OISYR3IYXKJ1,Shower heads are great but thr adhesive portion to hold hand held sprayer is terrible. It doesn't stick. This makes using this item veey difficult. That's the only flaw which is major for me.,2,2025-03-24,United States
R1T224F3PXL3EB,I bought it because it said high pressured. That’s simply not true.,3,2024-12-04,United States
RIOAMKRXED5J0,Worked awesome for first three months. But then the knob that is used to adjust the angle fell off and can’t be reinstalled because threads pulled through. Which is weird because the only time it was adjusted was during the initial after installation leak check to get the desired angle in the shower. A message has been sent to seller so will see how it goes.,2,2025-02-23,United States
RG8JAM3VZDO28,"Hubby purchased this for his shower. 2 down sides. 1 the part that came preassembled was put together backwards. 2 you can use the shower head alone but you can not use the hand held alone. high end ones have 3 settings: shower head, hand held, or both together. this one is NOT high end. it only allows shower head always on and hand held on or off. So when you want the hand held to rinse your under carriage you still have water coming down on your head even if you don't want it so your conditioner can set for a few minutes while you wash and rinse your body.",2,2025-01-12,United States
R3MWNDEUSBI0MP,If you’re looking for a high pressure shower head this isn’t the one. Definitely not anti-clog either. Ive had it for about 2 months and the little holes the water sprays from are all starting to clog or spray the other way. The design and durability is very good though. Really liked it but the very low water pressure was a big nope for me.,3,2024-10-21,United States
REGQ6FQVKFDLB,"I was hoping the rainfall shower head would feel like rainfall, but the waterforce is so soft, and I don’t appreciate it. I thought something might be wrong on my water line, but the handheld head works perfect and has much better and stronger water flow. Also the installation is not as simple as they claim it to be🤷‍♀️",3,2024-09-17,United States
R1EB0ZMHEP03JS,"Nice concept, nice look. But like everyone else is saying about the pressure it puts out, not much at all. And the fact that when you turn your shower off, it still trickles on you, It doesn't shut right off. I found that really annoying. Looks nice, works, kinda.......",3,2024-10-23,United States

R1LBE3GN04T97I,"The large one is really nice, and looks elegant in my tub. The hand held piece on the other hand it a bit cheap, and the mist setting is hardly a mist, it's more like clunky jets spraying at you. If you're looking for fine mist, this isn't it.",3,2024-10-14,United States
R15C2NMU4BCQ2Z,it is easy to install but water pressure is weak,3,2024-12-02,United States
RMTKIC570PXI7,It’s nice and it’s pretty but it’s very low pressure in my opinion. Takes forever to get soap out of my hair. I’ll have to buy another one.,2,2025-04-03,United States
R3O3JG86H5HAME,I loved how big this rain shower head is. I loved how the water was falling everywhere and I was covered in warm and that the extra head was handy for spraying the walls and dogs. What I don't like is how quickly this clogged and stopped spraying. I have tried everything to unclog the spray nozzles but they basically only spray from the middle at this point. It makes me super sad because I have wanted the rainwater type of head for a really long time and it's just not feasible with this head.,2,2025-01-07,United States
R36SEVRYNO8ASF,I expected the same or better water pressure from the large shower head but am disappointed to say it's more like sprinkling rain. The smaller wand does have a few settings with enough pressure to get the shampoo/conditioner out of my hair but I wanted more from the large shower head.,2,2025-03-11,United States
RVCIFFZOKNVO9,"Overall great shower spray would love it , but thr handle holder is made to stick to the wall- it fell after 3 weeks…. So now it looks awful with cord just hanging… would not buy again",3,2024-10-29,United States
RV9USXQRZW3G5,"Maybe it’s my fault for not reading better but I didn’t realize that the entire thing is made of plastic. A little annoyed I paid $60 for a plastic shower head, if I had realized that I wouldn’t have bought it.

It seems to be working fine so far, the pressure is nice and the wand settings are good. I’m a little concerned about the longevity.",3,2024-08-14,United States

R2OJ76TIJ3VD6Y,"The outer covering of the hand held shower metal covering broke off the shower head just after 2 months. This left the nylon tube inside exposed and when I tried to see if it would work, the nylon tube burst in the shower. Very disappointing. I had to attached the old hand held shower (fittings are standard) which I have had for over 5 years. I changed it out because my wife wanted a rain shower head. I won't purchase this again from this company.",3,2024-06-29,United States
RGQSDY2NIDBEE,Then constantly clogs up and water goes in all sorts of directions. Hard to clean it,3,2024-11-07,United States
RJU6UG7LZ1Q34,"bought this on prime day after reading reviews and hoped for the best.

knob turn to small head - head has great pressure.

knob turned to large head - severely lacks pressure and is a soft rain.

know in the middle for both heads - very low pressure out of both heads.

you'll want to run either or, not both. I have 52psi water pressure for reference.",3,2024-07-26,United States
R1LAM5L5CHVS5G,The hand held works well. Good pressure. The rain shower head is trash. Leaks at the connection. The middle part shoots down at a slant instead of straight down. Didnt bother me at the beginning but now half of pores are now doing it. Would not recommend unless you are trying to go cheap and dont really mind the rain head not working correctly.,3,2024-07-29,United States
RTQCAKJGJ04W3,"Purchased Aug 2024.

Easy to install. No problems there.

Ran great for a while, was a great upgrade from the previous setup.

Then, a few weeks back, it started to leak from the main shower head while the faucet runs to fill the tub.

I often switch it to the handheld just to avoid cold water dropping on my children when they sit in the tub as it fills. (It drips for about 5-10 minutes after the faucet is turned off.)

So.... for $50... I could have absolutely found a better option.

Very bummed because I really liked it.",2,2024-12-09,United States
R2I79HIY60DXCO,"First thing shipping was delayed (not happy as I pay for Amazon Prime), the photo makes the shower head look square but its a rectangle shape (not a real problem). The product is of good quality and easy to assemble.",3,2024-08-02,United States
R37BB3BK439RWA,"I wish the rainfall shower part had more pressure, right now its like a gentle drizzle. The wall bracket didnt stick well and I cannot figure out where to buy another without buying a whole new showerhead. The wall bracket did have a tolt function that was nice.

R2C5L06S2DPMA8,"We got the shower head and installed it already but after it was installed we noticed that it is missing the part that is needed to hold up the handheld wand. The shower head works great and so does the handheld wand but currently it is sitting on the floor of the shower. I am trying to reach out to the seller to see how I can get that part that holds the wand to the wall. We are happy with the product and even purchased a second one, not here yet, for our spare bathroom. I don't want to take it off just to return it and hope the new one comes with all of the needed pieces. I hope the seller sees this review.",3,2024-01-11,United States
RXZ8VWQ1YHKTV,"This is one of the worst shower head combos I have ever bought.

First the photos are deceptive. I thought the main shower head would be bigger. It is much skinnier than I wanted.

The handheld wand is the worst part. The plastic piece that is supposed to hold the wand is completely wrong it doesn’t hold it up well. It’s like it is not made for this set.

I tried reaching out to the seller about this but the Amazon AI chat assistant won’t let me. It only gave me the option to return it, but the return window has passed.

As a result of the poor attachment piece the shower wand keeps falling off the wall at the slightest touch and is scuffing up my shower pan pretty badly.

I do not recommend.",2,2024-08-18,United States
R2QB9V6QX1DUW0,"Loved this shower head, but it only lasted 8 months. The shower head fell randomly in the middle of the night. Lookes like it was too heavy and the connector piece broke 🙃",3,2024-08-31,United States
R2BXOAOHX7WCAX,Shower head is extremely heavy so i was only able to use the wand! You need a long heavy duty arm to put this showerhead on!,2,2025-03-06,United States

You go to wear them and they flip flops sound is so loud that you would have the attention of anyone in a restaurant or wherever you were asking that's not the worst problem though, I put on the brown ones and walked around the house for about 15 minutes and they ripped! These shoes were these ones like someone that really does not know anything about the actual foot or how to design something that your foot doesn't try to go off to the side every time and fabric is so we can feeble t's going to rip immediately.. going to have your foot go off to the Sun and you're going to be irritated by the sound! This hurts me to have to say this! My parents were in the shoe business for over 35 years in very very expensive ,upscale stores on lost soul is Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale florida! It's not quite as a skills it used to be, but I know it whole lot about shoes and fitting them and quality blah blah blah!

During that time, I noticed discoloration on my feet and initially thought it was a skin issue. However, I later realized that the flip-flops were causing the discoloration. It was quite alarming to see such a drastic change in my skin. I stopped using them immediately, gave my feet a thorough pedicure, and thankfully, my skin returned to normal.

I ordered the silvery gray in my usual shoe size 8.5 thinking it was great they actually had half sizes available. When I first put them on, they felt really good and seem to fit great with a nice cushioning yoga foot bed. However, within just a couple hours of wearing them, it seem like the straps had actually completely stretched out, and the shoes were basically almost falling off my feet. That is ridiculous and absolutely should not be happening. Obviously I got what I paid for and will spend the extra money for higher quality shoes next time. These I can no longer even wear anywhere except around the house.

R24RZFZL9T2X2K,"I've purchased this shirt four times since 2020 (11 shirts), and I feel like it gets worse with each purchase. The original shirt was amazing, it was the perfect material, fit great, and had a nice collar that fit perfectly.

The second order a year later had a collar that was about 2/3rds the size as the original and the material was thinner, but it still fit nice around the neck and held up well so I got used to it. I am still actually wearing some of these two years later.

For this most recent purchase, all five shirts had collars that were thin and loose, with almost no tension. They stick straight up instead of snug around the neck, and it is so loose that it feels like I'm wearing a polo with an open neck in the front. It's almost like someone grabbed the collar and intentionally stretched it out, but it's all five shirts so I assume it's by design.

If in the description it says “ultra cotton” or “ultra soft,” in my experience that means that scratchy textured material I cannot wear. In my experience it’s been 100% of the time. The real soft ones never have said that & honestly I can’t find them on Amazon period anymore unless it’s made by a brand name like adidas or Nike. Those are a bit pricey for work tops, & I realize these aren’t, but I wish they didn’t try to pull it off as being ultra soft when no person could honestly call this soft unless they’re Tarzan dressed in straw.

RL95Z96JVOZK8,"I do not understand all the high ratings for these shirts. These fit oddly and poorly. The neck is loose, the shoulder seams are spaced way too far apart (as if made for the shoulders of someone 4 sizes larger than XL--and I do have broad shoulders), the armpits have too much fabric & are baggy, the arm holes are too big, the part over the torso and waist is not generously cut. The main part of this shirt (the part over your abdomen and waist) is seamless--no side seams. That might explain the odd cut. I have many older Gildan t-shirts that fit more normally, and made of soft cotton. I previously tried the slightly lighter-weight current version, and it was incredibly thin, but also fit terribly. This model has heavier fabric, but the fit is unusable and the fabric is rough and not soft. I compared this t-shirt to six older t-shirts that I already own--all acquired from different places and made by various companies, including Gildan. This one is far worse than my others, and the lousy fit is my biggest reason for sending them back. At one time, I thought Gildan made great t-shirts, but after I tried several current models and colors and was disappointed, I am giving up on this company, and will try another brand.",2,2021-04-08,United States

They are still hanging in my wardrobe and I just haven't felt like pulling them out and trying to wear them. Maybe one day if i for some reason don't have any clean work clothes to wear, which pretty much never happens, I might try them, but when i have better choices for shirts to wear to work, I will not wear these.

R25HFV82ITRME0,"Right off: If I had tried them on before laundering, I would have returned these shirts.

They are so uncomfortable. I got an XL because I don't like tight shirts. These have enough room in the body, but if your body doesn't completely fill out the shirt (which would make it fairly snug), it does not hang right, so it feels like the sleeves are on backward. Like this: If I have my arms straight down, it's fine; and if I move my arm backward, it's fine; but if I raise my arm forward, it immediately pulls taut on the sleeve because I don't have a huge chest pushing the front of the shirt way out.

I've been wearing XLs for a while and I've only experienced this kind of cut once, with a Hanes T-shirt. I guess if I was bigger it would make things line up properly, but then the shirt would also feel too small. I have other shirts from this brand but this cut is much different.

They run a little on the short side, which is another reason I went with XL.

Wrinkles from Hell. No Cotten," BEWARE. Never, Never have I witnessed a shirt that retains wrinkles like this. Upon unwrapping it, I’m hit with my first disappointment. I don’t think there is a thread of cotton in this. it has that “nylon satin” look and feel like you’re in band or something. Look for the label and all you will find is tiny tag that says “design in Italy,” of all things.
Then comes the second, and REAL surprise! I wash it and run it through the dryer for 1/2 hour and it STILL has all the wrinkles from being packaged! Another wee tag says “iron on low or dry clean for best results. Screw that,.. I’m not spending more money at the dry cleaner just to look like I’m next up with a juggling act.
No, I didn’t read the comments, and this stands as my lesson.",2,"Does not even have a tag saying J-VER"" Says ""FLEX",United States
Poor workmanship," I feel sorry for people who never experienced decent menswear.""",2,"I seldom write an Amazon review, but this one seems necessary. I ordered this shirt to wear to my son's wedding over the weekend. Unfortunately I didn't look closely enough at the shirt until I had to put it on for the big event, so I had to wear it, thankfully under a vest and with a tie covering the front. Look at the photo and you'll see what I mean about poor construction. I placed a piece of red paper behind this fold so you could see the obvious defect. I used to sell men's clothing when department stores were in their heyday. I have never seen anything like this defect in a shirt that reached the store shelves. Overall, the material quality and stitching is subpar. I do not believe the stated 65 percent cotton content in this shirt, as the tail kept creeping up and out of my pants the whole night long. Partly, I guess, this is a situation of you get what you pay for."" However I bought it based on many good reviews here. These reviews mystify me. If this is what passes for a quality shirt today",United States
Black Streaks Appeared After Washing and Ironing,,2,"Before wearing the shirt, I washed and ironed it. As I was ironing, I noticed small black streaks in a few areas. At first, I assumed it was just water from the iron and that it would fade, but instead, the streaks became more noticeable. Upon closer inspection, I realized they were appearing all over the fabric. I had the iron set to the lowest cotton setting, so overheating wasn’t the issue. I washed the shirt again, hoping the marks would disappear, but unfortunately, they remained. Returning this one and getting a more basic ALL cotton shirt.",United States
"Poor quality, no French cuffs",,2,"I was really disappointed with this shirt. It doesn’t look like the photos at all. There are no cuff sleeves or French cut details—just a basic button-up that feels low quality. The top button, which you’d use with a tie, is tiny and very hard to fasten, making this a poor choice for dressier occasions. Definitely not a high-end shirt as the listing suggests. Wouldn’t recommend if you're looking for something formal or well-made.",United States
feels like something you'd wrap a dead body in,,2,"Creepy-feeling material. It reminds me more of some sort of industrial wrapping stuff than actual cloth. I've never worn a shirt that made me feel like a plastic store display mannequin, bit this one did. And there's no pocket. The description says that but I missed it. Perhaps I've led a sheltered life, but I've never seen a man's shirt like that. Ugh.",United States
Not professional,,2,"Returned. Didn't realize this shirt would be SO SHINY. Also seemed very cheaply made. If you are a really cool bruh wanting to wear this to prom in your stretch hummer, you might be happy with this shirt.

HORRIBLE,,2,Shirt was completely destroyed and gross. Had clearly been worm and sweated in. Had food and sweat stains from the color down the front. Did not even come in any sort of packaging was just rolled up in a ball. Completly disgunting and un acceptable. Steer clear!,United States
Not permanent press.,,2,"I expected a premium permanent press shirt. When it arrived, the folds were obvious so I decided to wash it. After washing and drying, the shirt looked worse than before.

You get what you pay for - and maybe less.,,2,"You get what you pay for. This shirt is presented as a quality fabric and is nothing more than a cheap, thin polyester.

SO SHINY,,2,"This shirt is Shiny. It is very, very shiny. It is so shiny. I ordered Black. It is reflecting so much light. It was packed in a tiny box, so that when I unfolded it, there were many creases. I put it on and looked in the mirror. Every crease and fold glimmered with a luminescent glow. It was hideous in appearance, and felt clingy even over a t-shirt. I took off the shirt and considered returning it, but I couldn't figure out how to get it back into that little, tiny box. It was a conundrum. Feeling like a fool for ordering a shirt online, and guilty for being wasteful, I threw it in the trash.",United States

Wrinkle free ya say?,,1,Shirt showed up a wrinkled mess. Supposed to be wrinkle free. Don’t fall for it. Fake news.,United States
Came used!!!!!,,1,The shirt came used!!!!! Stained with lipstick and smelled of cologne when I first opened it. The collar was filthy where it would’ve rubbed on someone’s neck.

Supposedly French cuffs but not!,,1,"Nice fabric, but sold and illustrated as a French cuff. I decided to order another thinking that it might have been a one time mistake.

Ugliest things I've bought recently. Unless you have a time machine for going back to a 1979 disco.,,1,"I recently tried buying a bunch of different shirts from Amazon, and by far this is the worst of them all. First off, the dark brown I ordered is actually sort of a maroon purple. Gross.
But that's the best thing about the shirt. After that it's shiny with big huge collars. So, unless you figured out how to make a time machine so you can go back to the disco's of the late 1970s, this shirt is hideous. The material feels like silky plastic. Shinier than my uncle's bald head. Tacky tacky tacky.
Returned.",United States

Wrong items,,1,"I ordered a men’s pink dress shirt in XLTall. When my uncle tried it on he loved it but it was too small. I ordered one in navy in a XXLTall and it fit perfectly, very well made and I’m extremely pleased with it. I went onto the same site, reordered the pink in the same size as the blue. It came as an XXLRegular and it is not nearly as nice. It’s a different brand, fabric, thickness, and quality. The blue and first pink came nicely boxed and are great. This one….no thanks",United States
Shiny and smells like plastic,,1,I wouldn’t buy this shirt personally. It doesn’t look very good. Doesn’t fit well and smells like plastic kind of like when you first open it shower curtain.,United States
Already worn,,1,Got the shirt delivered. After pulling package out of shipping envelope. Obvious that the packaging had already been opened and taped back shut.

Not smell good,,1,The shirt ordered came used with a horrible smell of perfume that cannot be tolerated. I need communication to see about that order.,United States
"Strange Fit better for a Woman, Bad stitching",,2,"I purchased a medium in white, but please note it has a purple/blue undertone to it. The material itself is very pleasant. Soft, light, and slightly silky. The problem lies with the design and quality of construction.

First- In numerous places the material was caught in the stitching and flipped the wrong direction when it should be laying flat. Also, the collar stiffness is weak. The one I received has a crumpled collar on the right side and it doesn't look like it will be easily flattened. I will need a lot of starch to keep it straight and flat.

Second- the fit. Shoulders and waist width fits slightly loose, but... It is MUCH too short. It is a length more fit for a woman. In fact, the entire look seems to be more cut for a woman, than a man. Also- the sleeves are too long (and the person I bought this for always has issues with sleeves being too short!). With the sleeves being too long and the kind of material this is? It gives the look of blouse"" sleeves that a woman would wear. (Remember ""Seinfeld's"" poofy shirt? Ha!) A woman would look great in this shirt wearing it untucked. It would fall about an inch below her hip line. NOT flattering on a guy.""",United States
Not wrinkle free !!,,2,"Absolutely not wrinkle free as advertised, this shirt was pulled out of the dryer early after being on the wrinkle free dryer cycle and still had this many wrinkles. That's a deal breaker for me.",United States
Not wrinkle free or wrinkle resistant,,2,"The shirt came in a tiny box and was folded to fit. I washed the shirt, placed it in the dryer with the wrinkle release setting and was very disappointed with the results. The description states wrinkle free.

Made of polyester,,2,"Item description says it's 62% cotton, 35% polyester and 3% spandex but based upon the texture and breathability, there is no cotton whatsoever.

The quality control is obviously non existent. They cannot spell or make a decent shirt! Plus they are sized small. Don’t believe their size chart either. More photos to come on the other shirts!

Poorly packaged must dry clean before wearing,,2,"The shirt arrives in a tiny box with so many fold marks in it it's not even funny and it's basically silk so it is very hard to iron and recommend dry clean only so it should be packaged in a way that it won't come to you balled up

Fell for the good reviews,,2,"This is a shapeless shirt. For older men who don’t care about style. It is a straight cut, is not anywhere near the body. It is essentially a potato sack. My son is 6’2” tall, 190 pounds. The shirt we ordered- sleeves are bulky and long. The body of the shirt is a square. Short, comes out of the pants. Shapeless, truly shapeless- it will work for someone who is shaped as a beer barrel. But not for someone who actually does have a male body shape. After reading the reviews I ordered two. One black one has arrived. As soon as i saw it- I cancelled the second one. I can’t believe that people actually praised this shirt…",United States
Nope.,,2,"It came to me all wadded up in a random bag. Presentation = no stars.

its trash,,2,the cut at the bottom is not true to the picture. examination of the add will show it recommends size large. I ordered a medium just to be safe but the medium was still to big.,United States
was used and stunk when recieved,,2,The first shirt I ordered came in a little box it had tags was new. Teal color.. I liked the shirt so I ordered another in black It came in what looked like a new plastic bag but had no tags on it and when I opened the bag it stunk..

R2XDHSHFKKYDOO,"I have purchased Brooks shoes for years. My first set was a pair of Ghost several years ago that lasted me a few years. I then purchased Launch GTS about 2 years ago. I needed a new pair and have always wanted to go back to Ghost, but this new model of Ghost fits wildly different. I have always been a size 9B in Brooks. The first pair I ordered, were WAY too small and narrow. I returned and replaced them with 9.5W, and they still fit uncomfortably. I wondered if this was potentially an Amazon issue, so I took a look at recent reviews of the Ghost and even other models on the Brooks website, and there were so many recent reviews all pointing out that new models of shoes are much smaller, narrower, and fit differently in the arch. This was incredibly disappointing because I loved the brand, and I loved the style of the shoe. I think I will be moving on to other brands of running shoes.",2,2025-04-13,United States
R3FSCLMASEZRTI,"I've worn the ghost 15s for two years and they were perfect. Would walk 5-10 miles in them every day and I'm so upset they are no longer made. The Ghost 16s are horrible. Not only do you have to size up with these, but you have to go up in the width as well because they are much narrower than the Ghost 15. Not sure what the hell they did to the cushion either, but the days I wore the Ghost 16s, my knees kept snapping whenever i squatted down (felt like knife digging into knee). The days I wore the Ghost 15s, I've had no issues with my knees. Additionally, the toe box is very different with the 16s; there's some hard material in there that when touched, it'll leave a dent that will be felt by the toes and does not pop back out unless you take the shoes off and manually pop it back out with your fingers.",1,2025-04-06,United States

Returned this inferior product to Amazon and reordered directly from Brooks. The far superior product I received from Brooks, eg, properly sized and no glue visible, only further confirmed that I had received a flawed product from Amazon.

R2H64I1VURR78P,"Brooks Women’s Ghost 16 Neutral Running Shoe. I gave them a stellar review when I first purchased them because thy immediately fit me. These were one of the top five. When I used a website for the best rated shoes that help with pronated ankles and was linked to Amazon.

I only use them for walking. I have been wearing the same style of Brooks Ghost shoe for 6 years and decided to get the updated ones for the wider toe box. I plan to go to Italy this year and thought the lighter weight would be an added bonus to pack.

In less than a week, these were showing wear. The sole was crushing down. The my previous shoe's soles, for lack of a better description, made with a dense rubber. These have a light weight, and I think low quality sole. I felt that they were stiff and I cannot imagine running in them.",1,2025-01-11,United States
R139ETY6YUIPUS,"Brooks Ghost has been my beloved walking/running shoe for years. I recently needed a new pair and purchased Brooks Ghost 16, in my usual size. I could not figure out why they weren't comfortable and kept adjusting the laces, changing socks. I finally compared the tongue of these shoes to a prior pair of Brooks 11 (see photos). The Brooks 16 tongue is lined with a different material which is thinner and rougher. It has less padding in the tongue and when the tongue bunches up it rubs and is very rough. The shoes are not wearable and I'm returning. So, so disappointing.",1,2025-01-30,United States
R1NWOQA9UES8QD,This shoe is short. I have Ghost 15. So comfortable. Ghost 16 was uncomfortable the moment I put them on. My foot hit the end and I went up a size. Why did Brooks ruin a good shoe with Ghost 15? Luckily found one to purchase. Change the shoe back please!,1,2025-04-11,United States
R2OUK8VR65PKPN,Big regret. Which is unfortunate because of all the fantastic reviews throughout the whole internet. This is my second time running 4 miles and I’ve been in excruciating pain. I am trying to push through as I hope this doesn’t end my running journey.,1,2025-04-12,United States

R344NIYUIQPTQQ,This is the second pair of brooks I have bought. The first pair was amazing. I was so impressed which is why I bought this pair. They look identical so I don’t know why these were so bad. But after two months they have worn down and are no longer comfortable! My last pair lasted me almost a year and through pregnancy .

They are short, sizing wise ( always an 8.5 in Brooks) they are narrow ( ordered same width as previous pairs) more rigid, and not at all comfortable like all my previous pairs, they look great, quality is great as usual but this style is not a good replacement for the 15. Would return, but I’ve worn them outside.",1,2024-10-24,United States
R2FETRK7BHO5G6,"Really disappointed in these. I bought these after reading good reviews, thinking that they would help with mild knee pain that I have. Unfortunately, they seemed to just exasperate the pain as every time I wear them my knees are sore for a day after. Additionally, if worn during workouts at the gym or doing any other activities they’re hard to balance in and wobbly. The foam sole feels lumpy and uneven. The tongue under the laces bunches up and digs into the top of my foot. I would’ve returned these right away, but wanted to wear them for a while and give them a fair chance. Definitely not worth the price. I would find something else.",1,2024-07-09,United States

R6B9I1WW3YXPJ,Very disappointed! The quality feels and looks cheaply made. The toe area is extremely short and narrow and doesn't fit like the other 6 pairs I've purchased and worn. They fit as if their a size or 2 too small. The soles are a light weight foam material that easily gets damaged from rocks or sticks or even a fingernail. The embellishment is a sticker on the sole.

R1HC757GV6UKHZ,I was excited to try these shoes as they were recommended as a brand that is comfortable and long lasting. Half of that was true. Very comfortable from the start but by the two month mark the black tread was falling off. The area under the toes and most of the foot has come off. I am walking on concrete and not rough terrain.

R23R6W0DGAMWGO,The new soles are awful. I have been wearing Brooks for many years and loved them. The Ghost 16 has a new kind of sole that is more of a plastic look and is very uncomfortable. My feet hurt and my legs hurt on the second day of wearing them. The inside is pretty flat with very little support. They have definitely cheapened the shoe A LOT! The new Adrenaline has the same type of plastic looking bottoms/sole as well. So sad because these have been the only shoes I've worn for years & now they are awful.,1,2025-04-08,United States

R33L19JNHHH8ST,"Updated 2/19/2025: I ordered these a 3rd time because my regular size 8 was too large, so I ordered a 7.5. The inconsistency in sizing of Brooks shoes in the same exact style and color from shoe to shoe is extremely frustrating. I really like these shoes, so I kept trying. The 7.5 is slightly short, so I was going to try ordering another pair, but at this point I’m giving up and will look for another style. Both pairs of size 8 ordered previously were too large, plus the logo on the outside was sewn on incorrectly on both pairs. I do not recommend these!

Updated review 1/27/2025: I re-ordered these, and the new ones are also sewn incorrectly. This time the logo rubs through the fabric on both shoes, so this is a defective design and/or shoe fabric. The arch support is poor, but the insoles are removable. It’s nice that Brooks changed to using athletic laces that stay tied and aren’t 10 inches too long. The toe-box of the Regular width is extremely wide, think clown shoes, with so much room that my foot slides around in the front. I love the color, and wanted so badly to get a pair that wasn’t sewn incorrectly, but that didn’t happen. Returning this second pair.

I like Brooks sneakers, as they keep me from having knee pain when I wear them, but it’s been very difficult to buy them as the sizing is often inaccurate, the fit is inconsistent, and they don’t offer the promised arch support, so I always end up paying extra to buy inserts. I bought these in Coconut Zephyr White, which is a pretty pink and cream color. It would be nice if the listed colors actually gave some idea of what the color actually is, but it’s always a surprise. I was happy to finally get a size 8 (my usual size) that actually fit, although the Regular width is SUPER wide at the front. They look like clown shoes, but I like the color. Sadly, the logo is sewn on wrong on the left shoe, causing it to rub on the side of my foot. I had to return them. I’m ordering another pair and will update this review accordingly.",1,2025-01-24,United States
R3TK55WPJI49YL,I was so grateful for Ghost 15s. I tried the Ghost 16 assuming they’d fit & feel similar. I was so wrong. What happened Brooks? I can’t wear these. The footbed is so hard! What happened to all that soft padding? All the toe room is gone. My toe hits the top of the shoe. Toe box is lower & shorter. They squeeze & cause terrible pain including the arch & heel. I almost couldn’t get my foot in the shoe at all. The opening of the shoe is so stiff & small. I can’t wear these. A bigger size doesn’t improve the fit or comfort. I am so disappointed.

R1O7EE32PALI8U,"Nice shoe. Have been buying crocs for many years. New to buying supposed authentic apparel from off Amazon or app websites. Every time I do weird situations arise, as like this. I bought 3 pairs of crocs from this website at the same time, that says Amazon selling crocs shoes with the crocs store website within the description. One of the pairs was inaccurate size and description. And as for these particular ones I bought 2 of the same size and color. It says size 9w and 7m. Unfortunately one fits extremely smaller than the other and one of them came in a crocs bag with crocs logo and product description. The other identical one came in a tear away bag with no product description. 3 pairs of crocs from this same website advertising crocs store and two out of three which have to be returned and are of the same exact shoes, color, and size that fits completely different (much smaller), than the identically purchased shoes bought at the same exact time.

As for the 3rd pair, I should’ve caught that it said men’s size 2. There is no such size as a men size shoe. Amazon/crocs are selling little kids shoes for adult prices in adult section. It was advertised as size 4w/2m adult unisex. Returning immediately. There is no such thing as a men’s size 2. I should’ve caught that.
It’s not an adult shoe. They are selling children sizes and charging adult prices. This is a kids croc.

R1GXMNW9UGS3RK,"Background: I've been buying Crocs Classic Clog, size Women's 9, for over a decade.

These look like Crocs at first glance, but there are at least 4 differences.
1. These are about one size smaller than all other Crocs of this same size & style.
2. There is an ugly bulging at the big toe, which is caused by #3 below.
3. The toe of the shoe curls significantly upward. I don't want my toes bent backward.
4. They say made in Vietnam. I called the Crocs company & was told that all their shoes are made in China.

This led me to add a #5 to this list.

5. Since all Crocs are made in China & these were made in Vietnam, does that also mean they lack the silver that is in Croc shoes? Silver kills the bacteria that causes odor, & I have noticed that any odor in them is gone by the next day. The silver is the reason I only buy Croc clogs.

Even if this company could send me a pair of shoes that aren't curled, I can't verify that they contain silver bc the only company I can call is Crocs, & they told me that if it says made in Vietnam, it isn't one of their shoes.",1,2024-02-08,United States
R321RYK3HKJLW,"Let's be real here, $55 for crocs is insanely overpriced and I wanted to bang my head into the wall when my family and I went to Marshall's and found crocs in the $25-30 range..... bought them for my job but sent the first ones back because they were oversized and the second pair literally reaches right up to my toes, I have to clip my toenails really short or else I can feel the front of the croc digging into my feet all day and pushing my nails back into my feet and it hurts :( I also can't wear any of my ankle-length socks with these because they completely slip off my feet, and the thought of buying brand new socks for the sake wearing one pair of shoes is....grrrrr.....

R37YXR42MR7GEA,"I have a pair of Crocs I bought at Dicks and wore them to and around Maui, Hawaii. The bottoms were very smooth and comfortable, but for some reason one of the straps tore and came off so I ordered the pair I'm now wearing from Amazon and they are extremely uncomfortable with nibs so long on the insoles that they hurt and make my feet ache. Being a diabetic I can't risk the crocs causing problem. I wondered about the crocs so I took them to an actual croc store in Myrtle Beach and the sales lady assured me they were authentic saying that it depends on what country the crocs are made in as to how the nibs are on the insoles. She suggested sanding off the nibs with sandpaper saying that is what her Dad did, The Croc employee was so nice, helpful, and sweet especially when I fell in the store. She only had one problem: her name wasn't Amazon. I wish I had sent the shoes back but for a swap-out but I didn't. I hoped the nibs would wear down. They haven't. In researching this particular order, I discovered the straps on the new crocs are removable, so I am going to look at removing them and placing them on my original pair of crocs. Croc Corporate is trying to help me and they have been extremely nice just like the Amazon employees with whom I have dealt. I guess I am just a balding, fat, Southern old coot who is too set in his ways about what he likes or doesn't. I look at my wife of 35 years and then at Amazon.

R1W53DQWNZZOR3,I have ordered 4 pairs from here in the past and the sizes were correct. Some made in Mexico and some made in Vietnam.

I need to get Crocs so bad and hat going to the mall but these are sized completely wrong. These also didn’t show the W and M size just M11 but it was not nearly large enough to be a Men’s 11. This has to be a manufacturers defect. Labeled correctly but size wrong or maybe it should have been labeled W11. Either way frustrating…I want to order several pairs in different sizes but the headache of having to keep returning is not appealing. Manufacturer needs to check their shoe sizes as they are way off. I see others have experienced the same thing. My previous ordered from a year ago or so were great.

R3L3MFGFVB4863,"For years, I resisted buying Crocs, mostly because I just thought they were so ugly. Personal taste aside, this past Summer I decided I would buy a pair to use for working outside. I am an avid gardener, and during growing season, I am always coming in and out of the yard, and I hate having to take my shoes on and off every single time so I don't track dirt into the house. When I saw these on sale, I figured they would be perfect for working in the garden.
After a couple of weeks of regular wear, I started to notice plantar fasciitis acting up. I wasn't sure what the cause was as I always wear shoes, even in the house. As soon as I stopped wearing the Crocs, the pain went away. A week or so went by and I started wearing them again. By the end of the day, the pain was back. Since I've stopped wearing them altogether, the pain is gone and has not returned.

RSKB6ROKYDKEY,"I have several pairs of old, original crocs and ordered these in the same size (M6W8), evergreen color. As others warned, these new crocs are nothing like the crocs of yore. They look like a shriveled version of the old crocs--narrower, shorter, and the toe box points upwards at the end. The old crocs were so loose that if you were seated you could forget they were on your feet--not so with these. They press against the top of my arch and the strap cuts into the back of my ankle. The toe box is still big enough, but the upwards angle causes my big toe joint to ache when I walk. The interior nubs are so pointy that it feels like some kind of neuropathy. Sort of like a soft bed of nails. Even when worn with ever-so-attractive socks. The material doesn't feel a cushy as the crocs that have several years wear on them. This is the 2nd pair I have tried and will now return. Made in Vietnam, for what that's worth. I assume that ordering a size up will only make them too large, and won't mitigate the other problems. Crocs, why did you have to ruin such a fine product?! Instead of making 50 million new colors, couldn't you just give us one option for an original croc?

Sizing down doesn't do much of anything to correct the fit because the width is still absurd and they feel like they are going to fall off my feet when I try to walk. Now I see that Amazon's website suggests sizing down for all of Crocs' standard clogs. Come on, I'm not going to play these silly games with shoe size.

Crocs are nice own other pairs, great for around the house if you haver pain in feet. Good shower shoe, and good idea to shower with them because they make your feet sweat bad which creates a smell that can then transfer to your shoes. Then you need to throw your shoes in washing machine and it becomes a lot of hassle so just make sure to check them.

The quality was not the same as others I have owned and the size is not the same. This one from Mexico though I bought my usual size was bigger somehow.

All this difference in quality caused a lot of unease for me. Had me checking if the product was genuine and lifespan of the material and what not. Turns out Crocs stopped manufacturing in Mexico in August 2018 which led me to research the Lifespan of the product. It says it should last up to 10 years if not used much. So guess I should have no issues with flaking and rotting

All am saying is quality control matters. The inconsistencies with the material and size caused a lot of unnecessary discomfort for me.

R1TN7QHJ320DHQ,"The following is a copy of my review of another pair of Crocs Classics (10M/12F) as this pair is one of three pair ordered separately but all suffering from the same defect — incorrect sizing.

These are Crocs and there's really nothing new to write about them — function over form, by a long shot, and they do seem to wear decently.

But the last three pair I've ordered from Amazon have been WAY off in size, obviously incorrectly marked.

As a size 10, I ordered three pair of Crocs 10M/12F at three different times. I received all three pair (at separate times) **marked** 10M/12F, but they were INCORRECTLY marked. They were at least one size too large, closer to 1.5 sizes too large.

Be prepared to return them if they don't fit properly, and note them **DEFECTIVE** as they are incorrectly marked.

Out of a total of four pair I ordered, only one was true to fit. Not a good record. I want to order one more pair, but I'm unsure as to whether to try again for my size or a size smaller. It may have been a bad lot and maybe now they're back on track.

PROTIP: Check out other buyers on Amazon because some sellers on Amazon list crocs with only a one size difference in the men and women. For example (8 women’s / 9 mens), it seems odd at first because that’s not how croc manufactures them but it IS more accurate, especially for this seller!!

The spikes in the sole are not flattened (unfortunately) and the bottom of sole does not look too worn, it is just that center part. It was probably made too thin.",1,2024-07-21,United States

Called and said I needed size 9 in the ones made in Vietnam and was assured I would receive the correct ones, but once again I got same size as my last order...size 10 that were made in Vietnam. Makes no sense why the sizes vary just because they are made in different areas. You never know which ones they will send. I give up! Also they advertise them as made in the USA...not right.",1,2024-01-28,United States
R5AB4YXZFZGGM,"Los Crocs eran perfectos al llegar: muy bien de lo ancho de lo largo y la puntera, eran exactamente la talla esperada. Los compré para mi esposo y él muy contento los estrenó regando el jardín y lavando el carro, luego los lavo y los puso a secar al sol. Esto no lo hubiera hecho porque al cabo de 2 horas al recoger sus Crocs ya eran más pequeños visiblemente y lo comprobó al ponerselos.
La verdad fue desagradable pero también muy cómico porque el talón le quedó completamente de afuera 😂. Claro nuestro hijo de 10 años se apuntó como candidato para usarlos y le quedaron muy bien siendo que él usa un #5 de niño que sería #7 de adulto. Así que disminuyeron 2 tallas.
Mi recomendación es que no los dejen al sol ni vayan a la playa con ellos porque regresarán de puntitas en ellos o descalzos con su hijo pequeño estrenando. 😂😂😂.
O bien compren unas 2 tallas arriba y luego al asolearse les quedarán perfectos. 🤨😉",1,2022-08-02,United States

I held onto these for a Christmas gift and was totally embarrassed when my daughter opened them and they were 2 completely different sizes of shoes and she is now unable to wear them. We are now stuck with shoes that she can't wear and I am out of money from this purchase. I don't understand how there is nothing they can do about this considering it wasn't my fault!

Well after going through the quick exchange thing on Amazon I waited for my new ones. They arrived on time, but to my dismay they were too small again. Now I thought this was weird because its a FULL size up and the original ones I ordered were only JUST too small. So I compared them to the originals and sure enough, they were the exact same size despite being labeled a size larger. They were each manufactured in different countries and the 2nd pair had some weird stuff going on with how they were packaged. But idc about the packaging.

Anyway was putting them on in May of 2023 and the strap broke on one of them.

R3BA646772I3KC,"Well, I didn’t want to believe the reviews about sizing being off, but alas...here we are.
I ordered the black ones in a women’s 7. The left shoe fits great, the right shoe is about a size too big all over — like it’s it’s longer AND wider.
Nope, it’s not that my feet are different sizes either — the shoes are visibly different in size, see pics.
These ones say made in China, but in fairness, so does an older pair that I have— those ones are in fact genuine, so the place of manufacturing may not have anything to do with the authenticity as others have suggested.
I think the issue is that Crocs quality control isn’t great. I bought a pair of the heeled wedge sandals a few years back and the straps are snug on one foot not another. I thought it was my foot so I kept them, then I bought another pair of the exact style in a different color and they were perfectly fine!

RKG0WD5ZI31WL,"I have two pairs of these Crocs already, and bought this third pair in another color. They have changed. All three pairs are labeled the same size. 1) This pair is much wider than they used to be, much wider than my other two pairs. 2) This pair is much shorter in length than the other two. 3) The strap is much looser with a wide gap between the shoe and the strap when the strap is in the up position.
These are my go to shoes, but I can't wear this new pair because they are so much wider. (My feet are different widths. One is regular width and the other is large width. These are too wide on my large width foot.) Having the strap stick up much higher than the shoe looks really off. Looks like it has the wrong strap on. Quality has gone downhill and it appears there is no size control now. My other two pairs are the same size, while these are wider, shorter and wonky. So disappointed.

Update: The new replacement crocs (black) don’t fit either. They are smaller than other crocs I have purchased in the same size (green).

So be careful cleaning them. You may have regrets like myself! What a waste of my money!!!

**ordered a second time because I loved the heel cushioning these offered up until the left foot shrunk. We shall see how the second pair work out. So far, so good but I haven't attempted to clean them either. I will update after I do. I have to say I am absolutely DISGUSTED I have not heard from the seller!

R34TNAQBB6DN4R,i wear size 14 boots with a little wiggle room in the toes but im always a extra wide foot so thats what screwed me. size 14 croc had just enough toe space but very tight around my feet. i think its safe to say i needed size 16 in these. but ordering a 16 seemed insane at the time. after i returned the size 14 i got for $15 i went to order the size 16 but they jumped from $20 to $35 and still holding at that price. i was sick of flip flops breaking and excited to try cocs but im not happy with the sizing or price hikes. i hope to own the 16 someday but even if they fit better it was a lot of plastic-on-skin contact and feet got very hot and dirty. i see why people wear socks with these. i live in FL so foot wear that is not hot is important. all in all im just not impressed and wished they would of fit the first time. i would of gave them 3 stars probably if they fit. i dont see this product being worth 5 stars or worth over $20 no matter the fit.,1,2018-01-08,United States

I thought maybe my 9 year old granddaughter could wear them. I took them over to her and they did fit but she didn’t like the color.
I honestly don’t have the money anyhow, so back they went. It was hard also to return. They needed a printed label.

They are now “Made in Mexico” and they used raised printed lettering on the inside of the heel strap that is very uncomfortable. When my son pointed this out and how uncomfortable it would be I thought he was kidding. Sure enough I ran my fingers over it and yeah it would be very uncomfortable. Luckily I had his previous pair and was able to remove the heel strap, without any printing, and replace it on the new pair. Most people may not have this option so I would caution against buying these as I know it would rub against the skin and be very uncomfortable. Bad decision from the manufacturer!

R10EEQE84MZUU,"I own several pairs of Crocs because I need to walk on soft surfaces but I also need some arch support. The old Crocs were absolute perfect for this. I could wear them for many hours and felt like I walking on clouds!
I just received two new pairs but, I am going to return them because, unfortunately, the inside of these Crocs are not as comfortable as the original ones: the bottom is not as soft, the support arch is not as strong, and those little bumps on top of the soles are sharp to the point of being painful. I tried to wear them with socks but I still would not be able to wear them for long hours at home or outside.
It seems that, in very recent years, some genius at Crocs has decided it was a good idea to make them more uncomfortable. Crocs have been very popular for many years not because of their looks but because of the high level of comfort they provided. I understand they felt the need to improved the look by coming up with more designs, colors, glitters, etc. but, why did they diminished the comfort? Did they think we wouldn’t notice it?
Please bring back the old softness of the sole, the supporting arch, and take the sharpness of those tiny bumps away!

RPPRCAN5LVM9B,"My kids are completely sold on the comfort of their Crocs, and for wearing around the house, they seem perfectly adequate. The ease with which they can be slipped on and off is convenient for indoor use. However, when it comes to venturing out, I strongly feel these are not appropriate footwear for public settings, with the exception of the pool or beach where practicality takes precedence. While they are easy to clean and durable enough for casual wear, their very distinct and, in my opinion, unattractive style makes them unsuitable for general public outings. Ultimately, their utility feels limited to a very specific set of circumstances, making them a less versatile footwear option overall. I guess I'm getting old, but for what are essentially foam shoes, I also feel they are overpriced unless you can snag them on sale.",2,2025-03-24,United States

Third & final time I ordered size 9 womens. Not sure what's up with Crocs, but the foot bed fits when sitting. Take a step and my toes move forward & jam against toe box. This has happened with size 8, size 9 in Crocs as well as Nautica brand. I tried wearing socks to keep my foot in place & although it helped a tad, it was NOT the solution. I had worn them out for a day to give them a true test. Unfortunately they failed the test & I cannot return them. Prior to buying on Amazon I looked for local shoe stores that sell them so I could try them on in person. For such a popular shoe I was surprised to see them lacking in shoe stores! Money wasted, lesson learned.

R7H7X15H98QS5,"I am trying to replace my worn out Crocs and am not happy with how wide they are now. I ordered another pair first, but they were way too wide and because they were a different style, I assumed that style just ran wider. So, ordered another pair in the same style as my old Crocs, and found them to be really wide, also. My feet just kind of swim in them. You can see the difference in width, even though the sizes and styles are the same. Too bad they didn't just offer a wide version instead of making them all wide - they are not nearly as comfortable to wear now.",2,2024-07-23,United States
R27SH934YMFUVT,"Size 12 for Crocs Classic Crush Sandal was too large. My foot often slid forward. When the left front strap broke, it was beyond 90 days to return them to Crocs, 13601 Via Varra, Broomfield, CO 80020. So, from Amazon, I ordered these Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs in size 11. Size 11 is too small. When the size is too small, the heel strap pulls the top edge of the sandal up and onto the skin of the foot. After wearing them two times, the sandal’s posterior edge (closest to the ankle) on the medial side (above the arch) wore my skin off in a line on both feet. I had to tape cotton on my feet over the painful wounds while wearing Beslip Women’s/Men’s Garden Clogs, size 11.5, that I bought at Amazon. In addition to the half size, Beslip Women’s/Men’s Garden Clogs have a much more accommodating curve for the top edge of the sandal. Conclusion, Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs are okay if you don’t need a half size. Otherwise, feet either slide around in them or they are too tight and create a wound.",2,2023-07-23,United States

It came slightly dirty on the bottom which I didnt care because they're crocs and I can wash them but I couldn't figure out why the 9s were still so freaking big so I ordered a size 8 to try which are a little tight. I finally looked at the bottom of the 'size 9s' and they had sent me another size 10. I went to check the black plastic hang tag, that said mens 7/ womens size 8! Wtf! The women's 8 that I received was marked on the hang tag as a mens 5/ womens 6 but om the bottom says womens 8. These are all mislabeled so keep that in mind when ordering and make sure you're sent the right ones!

Around the end of March, I noticed, my left hip started hurting, and then my left knee too, a bit. In July, I wondered if maybe it was the new shoes I was wearing every day, and decided to try not wearing them anymore. It is October now and my knee seems ok, and the hip has improved a lot. This probably would have happened with any pair of plastic shoes I had chosen. Before these Crocs, and after, I have been very happy with my New Balance athletic shoes.

More importantly, they are not made properly either. I have been lucky to have nearly symmetrical feet- I rarely find a pair of shoes that fits one foot but not the other. The Croc's right shoe fits properly, the left pinches/rubs my big toe. I took them off and looked carefully and the left one is curved inward at the toebox.

R20VSFFPLXAKM0,"I bought a size 9 (women) since I wear a 9 in a sandal. I wear a 9.5 in a closed toe shoe. But there was a recommendation in this description that half sizes should order down. So I thought a size 9 would be just right for me. Alas, they are too short. The end of my toes touches the front of the shoe even without a sock. So I immediately had to put them back in the box and return them. According to my experience, one would order a size up, not a size down. A 9 is too short for a 9.5 foot. Still, they are very nice and attractive shoes, so I'm ordering a size 10. I'm giving 5 stars because there was nothing wrong with the shoes, just bought the wrong size and don't think the description should have suggested ordering a size down.

Update: I have to change my rating from a 5 star to a 2 star for the simple reason that they will not work for someone like me with exactly 1/2 size off. After the above-described experience (ordering a size 9 women for my 9.5 foot), I sent them back and ordered a size 10 women. They are enormous. I can't possibly wear them even with a very thick sock. They fit me like boats. I really wanted to like these, and except for their being a smidgeon too small in size 9, I really would have liked them. I guess I have to give up on Crocs. I would guess there are a lot of people like me in between sizes who can't make them work. Much of the problem might be that when the size gets larger, both the length and the width increase. I didn't need them any wider at all, just a tiny bit longer. Too bad.",2,2016-10-07,United States

They were the most comfortable shoe for hanging around the house or cooking in the kitchen for long periods of time. My house has tile or hardwood so there isn't a lot of give there. Those Crocs were made out of a softer, squishier rubber that had a lot of give to it. These Crocs are made of a firmer material that seems like it has some plastic in it. They aren't very cushioned. They are also a lot smaller. They fit but just barely. Don't know if that's because I got a pair from Mexico instead of China (and how weird is it to be hoping you get one of the ones from China but all the reviews agree they fit better than the ones from Mexico.) Also these have anti-fatigue nubs inside. They are arranged in ridges, higher in some parts than others. You can see it's meant to be higher above the ball of your foot, under your toes but the weird sizing keeps my foot from fitting perfectly in that area so mostly I'm just walking on uneven nubs. I don't know if they work for anti-fatigue because they hurt my feet and I can only wear these shoes for about an hour at a time. I suppose it will be like when I was a kid in the summer and at first it hurt to go barefoot outside but after a while your feet toughen up and it stops hurting. Not thrilled though to have paid money for shoes that my feet have to toughen up for. They are also a lot hotter to wear than my old Crocs.

R37OZ434MZ33B6,"I absolutely loved the Brooks ghost 13 so when those wore out, I bought myself the 14 version. There were a few changes to that version that made it very uncomfortable, particularly with the back lip of the sneaker being curved in and rubbing my ankle and causing blisters so those went back. I went to another brand for a while, but really wanted to try the ghost again, but sadly, the same issue remains. The bottom of the shoe is incredibly supportive, but it’s very hard and after a while, it becomes uncomfortable and the same back lip issue persists. I got terrible blisters the first time I wore these. I don’t know why they changed the shoe and why manufacturers don’t realize that the back part of the shoe shouldn’t curve in. Bo more Brooks for me.",3,2024-12-04,United States

(Why on earth do they keep doing that?). For years, I was a faithful Asics runner. Then the toe bed started pinching my feet. After some trying on lots of shoes, I found the Brooks Ghost line. I have had about 7 or 8 pairs. It feels like the Ghost 16 is tighter than my previous Ghosts (recently, a few pairs of the Ghost 15). I will wear this pair, but am already starting my search at local stores for a new brand and model.",3,2024-10-06,United States

R2540R3BVUKWJM,"I’m a longtime Ghost user and have owned the Ghost 12, 13, and 14—I’ve loved them all. I especially appreciate the cushioning; walking in them feels like floating on clouds, even during long walks. Unfortunately, the Ghost 16 was really disappointing. The sizing runs much smaller than usual, even though I ordered the wide version. They also lack the soft, cushiony feel that I’ve come to expect from this line.

They are still painful to my feet and my wallet. Not for me.,2,2025-04-07,United States
R352K0OU7XTAVI,I own Brooks Ghost Max 2 and I really love them. But it’s a bit expensive so I went with Max 16 thinking it’s a less cushioned version of Ghost Max 2. But they are completely different shoes. Max 16 runs narrow and short and hard. Over all they are very uncomfortable and made my feet really hurt after walking for 20 min.

I needed a new pair and have always wanted to go back to Ghost, but this new model of Ghost fits wildly different. I have always been a size 9B in Brooks. The first pair I ordered, were WAY too small and narrow. I returned and replaced them with 9.5W, and they still fit uncomfortably. I wondered if this was potentially an Amazon issue, so I took a look at recent reviews of the Ghost and even other models on the Brooks website, and there were so many recent reviews all pointing out that new models of shoes are much smaller, narrower, and fit differently in the arch. This was incredibly disappointing because I loved the brand, and I loved the style of the shoe. I think I will be moving on to other brands of running shoes.",1,2025-04-13,United States

Not only do you have to size up with these, but you have to go up in the width as well because they are much narrower than the Ghost 15. Not sure what the hell they did to the cushion either, but the days I wore the Ghost 16s, my knees kept snapping whenever i squatted down (felt like knife digging into knee). The days I wore the Ghost 15s, I've had no issues with my knees. Additionally, the toe box is very different with the 16s; there's some hard material in there that when touched, it'll leave a dent that will be felt by the toes and does not pop back out unless you take the shoes off and manually pop it back out with your fingers.",1,2025-04-06,United States

These are unfortunately pretty hard and stiff. I don't feel any soft cushion under my soles and they're not very flexible. So far all I've done is long walks in them (3-4 miles at a time) and they are less comfortable than my old Sauconys which were about $50 cheaper. These also run a little short. I went up a 1/2 size as I usually do for running shoes and my big toe is grazing the front end. Not worth the extra price.,2,2024-10-11,United States

In less than a week, these were showing wear. The sole was crushing down. The my previous shoe's soles, for lack of a better description, made with a dense rubber.

For a bigger guy, my legs are relatively skinny, but when I sit down for more than a few minutes in these boxer briefs, I can see the lines left in my legs where it was cutting off my circulation. I bought Hanes boxer briefs from elsewhere (Wal-mart) before and never had this problem. I still have some pairs to compare and see the legs have much more room in the old ones. I don't know if Hanes was trying to save a little money by cutting the cloth a bit tighter in the legs, but I hope they get sued if someone loses a leg or dies from a blood clot. I don't know if it was just this horrible batch, the Amazon seller, or Hanes that made the change to cutting off circulation, but I went with a different brand, hoping for better results.

R3QODGVV0NQ431,"Title: Disappointing Experience with Hanes Underwear

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

I recently purchased a pack of Hanes underwear with high hopes, given the brand's reputation for comfort and quality. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory, leaving me with no choice but to share my disappointment.

The most glaring issue was the poor fit of the underwear. Despite selecting the correct size based on the sizing chart, I found the underwear to be uncomfortably tight and restrictive. The waistband dug into my skin, causing discomfort throughout the day. It was surprising to encounter such a basic fit problem from a brand like Hanes, known for its commitment to providing comfortable undergarments.

The restrictive nature of the underwear also made it challenging to move freely. Whether sitting for an extended period or engaging in physical activities, the underwear failed to provide the flexibility and ease of movement that one would expect. This lack of comfort was a constant reminder of the poor fit, making it difficult to go about daily activities without feeling constantly bothered.

Another notable issue was the overall quality of the material. The fabric used in these particular Hanes underwear felt cheap and lacked the softness that the brand is typically associated with. After just a few washes, I noticed signs of wear and tear, further adding to my dissatisfaction.

In summary, my experience with Hanes underwear was disappointing, primarily due to the poor fit, restrictive design, and subpar quality of the material. For a brand that has built its reputation on comfort, this particular product fell short of expectations. I would caution others to carefully consider their options before choosing Hanes for their underwear needs, as my experience suggests that not all products from this brand live up to its well-established reputation.",1,2024-02-26,United States

So I laid them side side with by last Hanes purchase and some Polo underwear. Photo speaks volumes. Yes, I realize the older ones stretch with age, but they were new a one point and fit perfect.

One size from one brand may fit well, yet the same size from another brand may be too loose or too tight, so I know I must be prepared to try a little.

First the red, blue, and green: these three pairs have weird stitching along the bottom of the leg holes. Due to the stitch type, they do not stretch. I work in the textile manufacturing field with sewing operations and this is not something that I would expect on this type of clothing. I am an average size person (6 foot tall, 200 pounds) and these boxers are uncomfortably tight on the thighs. So tight that I actually debated leaving work on lunch break to go home and change. Maybe these are a good fit for chicken little or someone without legs? Also they are a little tight in other areas with very little stretch it you catch my drift.

The black and grey pairs have a normal stitch along the legs which allow them to stretch and fit. A better fit in the thighs, but still tight in other areas.

R1WILGPCMGKBL,"It's so weird to me that men's underwear manufacturers put the soft side of the waistband on the oustide and the rough, irritating side inside against your skin. These are the worst I've ever purchased from Hanes. They do not fit well, the waistband is loose (YES, I got the right size for me).

RTMUA32IYHF45,"Rating was reduced to one star, because there is no indication of no star: Length for warmth. But no front support, just loose fitting. There is perfect feeling of fit and assurance, on the legs. But on the front, where it matters, there is the absence of feeling, the sensation of discomfort because there’s no credible specific support. Colors or style, or contrast stitching don't matter. It's what counts. The photos showing the presumption of a front, contoured support, do not 'support' the actual garment itself. There isn't any of the picture contour of the front that exists when wearing this undergarment. Candidly, it should be the form of a cup, that actually acts like like a supportive sewn in area. Akin, politely said, to a brassiere, that should have the support feature yet it's only a loose fitting fabric that offers no assurances.

I also like the feel of the fabric. However, I’ve noticed the quality is super questionable. Stitching coming out open arrival or after one cold wash and air dry, paint or adhesive was on one upon arrival, pilling after one wash. The majority of the 10ish I bought have these issues. They aren’t going to last and aren’t worth more than the 11ish dollars I paid for them. It’s too bad bc they are great otherwise.",2,2025-04-03,United States
R32UV244OSAMCA,Extreme pulling/fuzz on all areas not just high friction areas. I got these to travel. They started looking awful before I even made it to the airport.

The fit is decent, though it’s slightly short, and it’s soft—nothing exceptional, though. The biggest issue is the pilling. After just a week or two of wear, it started to pill badly, and that was even before washing it! For the price, it should hold up better.

It’s a good casual hoodie, but if you want something that lasts without getting that worn-out look quickly, I’d recommend looking for a different option.",2,2025-01-18,United States

I've actually bought a few hoodies from them on Amazon over the years, and the XL was much bigger in the past than it is now. What's up with that?

I wanted to keep them at least for around the house but man It's actually wild. I tried to untie the knot & bring it higher to the middle of my foot. It look different but helped but it's still so loose it's scary to take one step. So disappointed they're kinda cute, thick, soft soles.",2,2025-04-08,United States

R36633LTWUYKG3,"These look really cute on but the bands are too loose on my feet. Maybe if you have chubby feet, they'll be better but much too lose for my normal sized feet. I have to curl my toes to keep the shoes on my feet, which is bad for your feet (hammertoes). Plus I know they will get looser with use. Also, the soles do not have arch support. They are soft and squishy, but that's all. I have plantar fascitis that goes away with shoes that have even moderate arch support. These do not and my heels hurt after just a couple of hours. For $10 you get what you pay for, I'll likely discard the after 6 months use.

R3KTMPZO0TT4AJ,"These are basic loud flip flops. They are comfortable but should not be sold as having arch support. They have a small elevation at the arch but they provide no relief or arch support if you have fallen arches or some other issue with your arch. I wear orthotics and can say there are many more sandals that have true arch support. Just keep looking. Skip these. GIving 2 stars because they are soft as I place my feet in. But no arch support, they are loose, so they flop and make noise when walking, plus they have a weird chemical smell that I'm guessing will eventually wear off.",2,2024-08-28,United States

R2LCNMHPRL7JWP,"These were so nice at first. They are comfortable and fit as expected. I have short toes so to have the right ratio of toe and heel distribution in the thong was important to me. Usually my toes don't meet the front edge and my heels hang off the back. These were just right. I bought them to only wear in the house. But.. after a week or so, the thong material started stretching out and I kept catching the front of the flip flop on the floor and bending it under, tripping me up as I walked in them. They just kept getting more and more loose, even tried washing them to shrink the fabric hoping to get them to last but I just threw them away today! What a waste. The material was so nice and soft, but that, unfortunately, seemed to let them stretch way too much to have any longevity to them.",2,2023-06-27,United States
RQS3LEK557YTC,"The band is stretchy, thereby making the shoe unstable. If it gets wet, it is even stretcher. These are worthless unless maybe a person has super wide feet. THE SOLE IS GOOD. I wish the band was made of non-stretchy material because it is not fun to grip the shoes with your toes constantly, just to keep them on. Big fail but could be good with better straps.

RCDS11QXD1G61,"It’s too easy to get the sole of the thong caught on the floor, either sides or front.

R2EG6ZQMY6NX9D,"They look exactly as pictured. First time I put them on they were SUPER comfortable, both the foot bed and the fabric part between your toes and on top of your foot. The only problem is that after 1 week of wearing them at home, inside, for about 2-4 hours a day, the fabric between the toes is is unraveling in layers. At the rate it’s going, they might make it another month with the way I’m wearing them. I will have worn them for maybe 2 1/2-3 months. They were not expensive, but I still expected them to last a bit longer, especially since I’m not wearing them outside and for a full day.

RL9SJZWGWXJAG,I saw these on the today show and they claimed they were made out of yoga mats and had an arch support. I figured it was a good price. I would give them a try.

R1M46BGO6AQSU8,The design is so cute but the foot straps are too loose. We all know getting caught in the rain can be a real disaster in a pair of flip flops.

R1YF1SG28W1LJG,Bought these for a trip to Mexico and after one day of use by the pool and beach the cloth straps became much looser.

The sizing runs much smaller than usual, even though I ordered the wide version. They also lack the soft, cushiony feel that I’ve come to expect from this line. It doesn’t feel like a Ghost shoe at all. What happened to our dream shoes, Brooks Ghost?",2,2025-04-09,United States

R2SFI6V6RNU06G,As an older female with some back issues I was looking for a good pair of running shoes with lots of cushion to make the jog smoother and less jarring. These are unfortunately pretty hard and stiff. I don't feel any soft cushion under my soles and they're not very flexible. So far all I've done is long walks in them (3-4 miles at a time) and they are less comfortable than my old Sauconys which were about $50 cheaper. These also run a little short. I went up a 1/2 size as I usually do for running shoes and my big toe is grazing the front end. Not worth the extra price.,2,2024-10-11,United States

I wear these shoes every single day so that might be part of it but at this price point they should last for several months. I don’t run or do any heavy workouts.

RGEF9BN76WFSX,"Pros:
The first lasted a year with almost daily wear, some significant heavy duty wear. They were great wide toe box shoes, and the fit was perfect. They took some getting used to because you still feel rocks and things due to a thin sole, but mostly that’s fine. On occasion it can be a little pokey. They are SUPER slippery on wet rocks or tile, in the grocery store even.

Now for some reason the color of the rubber on the bottom this time is almost pink instead of tan. (I have the black and “gum” color)
They are definitely much less sleek with that pinkish tint

In my pictures you can see my first shoe (granted, worn and dirty) is more tan (especially on the side where it’s more original color) rather than the new shoes which are reddish pink?

The wide toe box is basically non existent on the new pair. It really rubbed on my pinky toe. There should not be a period of “breaking them in” with wide toe box shoes— so I’m sending them back. In my picture you can see my old shoe on the right is much wider. Thats how they should be. Overall— disappointing because they were shoes I would have bought over and over again until the design changes.",2,2024-09-29,United States
R1EE7UHW6IUZHF,"Buyer Beware! With these shoes, you get what you pay for. I've had multiple pairs of another brand and these don't compare.

R19N9JDJ56ZNDF,"Not super white. A very slight yellowing.

The first pair lasted roughly a year. The second pair 6 months. The most recent pair less than 5 months. Note: I was wearing them all day every day under normal conditions. Not running miles and miles, or being rough on them.

I really love these shoes and would continue buying them if they would last at least a year. I understand that you can only expect so much out of a $40 pair of shoes, and that you get what you pay for. But lasting less than 6 months is unacceptable and the normal price has gone up nearly 10 dollars in 2 years, so I can no longer justify the purchase.",2,2024-10-25,United States
R1FSWEE97NTTMH,The price to get these is phenomenal. Overall I I’ve had a lot of barefoot shoes even Vibram toe shoes but they kept ripping after a year or so. I do a decent amount of outdoor running. I got these to try out and while the price is good they start to fall apart after about 3 months of running ont hem about 10 miles a week or so. You can tell the quality is very mediocre but you can’t really beat the cost. You can already see the sole starting to detach from the shoe and the inside or whatever that’s called just crumbles up inside once you run on them a few times. I ended up just taking it out. I wouldn’t buy them again,2,2024-11-14,United States
R3I73HL4DYN9ZW,"I was hoping the lace-up variant of this minimalist shoe would replace my worn Crocs/Croslite sneakers which I liked but found dangerously slippery and prone to wearing out extremely fast.

Unfortunately, while I loved the design, breathability, tread on this shoe, and reasonable comfort for my wide-ish feet in the toebox, I simply couldn't get the heelbox to stay secure and avoid unwanted rubbing/friction as I walked in this shoe. It wasn't a length issue (the shoe was the right size from heel to toe), nor was it a lacing issue (I adjusted the tension in all sorts of ways on the laces). It's just that the heel cup wouldn't follow and stay with my foot and would rub with every step as I lift my forefoot. Perhaps it's a design problem with the rigid side-molding in the mid-foot that's to blame? Although I thought I could adjust to it over time, on a recent 30 minute walk, I got blisters on both heels.

Although the lace-up style didn't work for me, it might work OK for you. Still, based on my experience, I can't recommend it.

That being said, I have a pair of Whitins barefoot trainers that I love and highly recommend — the style with the Velcro strap, tension string/cinch style lace and more of the Vibrams look). Although the velcro-equipped shoes are not stylish, which reduces their versatility, the comfort is exceptional and I highly recommend them as versatile zero-drop fitness shoes. I've hiked, shot baskets, jogged in them on grass and pavement, done kettlebell and bodyweight training, etc. They're not lightweight as far as minimalist/barefoot shoes go, and they're not stylish. But they seem quite durable and the comfort is great.",2,2022-08-26,United States
R1Q6JK9ASUO7DF,"These used to be very flexible and allow for greater movement. I used to get another pair every ~6 months or so for a few years.

R88BV5WDV7AAH,"Maybe I'm not used to the type of shoe. But they were the most uncomfortable pair I've tried.

R1GL1ZRV50TST,Comfortable but I don’t think they’re gonna last long. First workout doing mountain climbers and a lot of the tread ended up on the floor. Same when jump roping… pile of tread after 15 minutes. Comfortable but cheap.,2,2024-12-16,United States
RMB8174DLCD0C,"I've been using these on and off for months.

Pros:

Very light weight.

Simple/elegant design.

Price is good.

Cons:

They're light weight because they offer no support whatsoever. This is fine for sprinting or running on the front of the foot, but the moment you start jogging and hit the back of the foot, it becomes uncomfortable and even painful real quick.

Due to the lack of structure/the fact that these shoes are flexible, it feels like tying your shoes doesn't actually do anything. I can remove the shoe while it's tied very easily by just bending the back off. This is both due to the flexibility/lack of structure, and the shoelace placement not being high enough on the shoe to actually be useful.

Bottom line, I bought these shoes to run in, and when I run in them, it hurts. It makes me not want to run, and definitely not run with these shoes on.",2,2024-03-17,United States

R95NYZ55XTR4U,"I mean the overall look is a number on itself, but as far as being a work shoe, this model wasn't built for grip on smooth surfaces.

I mean that's great if you're looking to possibly toughen your souls, but there has to be a better way.",2,2024-08-10,United States
R32FX1TOP99LST,"I was excited about these shoes as the title states they have a wide toe box and they’re “barefoot”. When i tried them on for the first time I was sorely disappointed. The toe box is similar in size to the DC Anvil as you can see in the picture.

I also found the shoes to be tight around the middle of the shoe even though i ordered a size up. There’s also an arch support. If you look at the bottom of the shoe you can see this arch is built into the soles of the shoe. My feet love flat soles and any bit of an arch support hurts by the end of the day.

I wish these lived up to the features in the name as they appear to be made well and are a great value for the money. Sadly they’ll be returned due to the issues above.",2,2023-09-24,United States

-The fit felt similar to water shoes where the elastic snaps at the ankle.
- My toes were tightened towards the front
- The right foot was slightly tighter than the left
- The rubber grip on the floor made slight suction sounds as I walked my house
- The look was not flattering for me or my spouse whom I asked for opinion

R2MY4P8R5XSY0A,"I recently purchased a pair of shoes on July 16th that claimed to be long lasting, but unfortunately, I have already worn through the heel. While the shoes are comfortable and look great, I am disappointed in their durability. As someone who walks daily with my dog and works in an office, I need shoes that can withstand daily wear and tear. My ASICS typically last me about a year before showing serious signs of wear, so I was hoping for similar longevity with these shoes.

Overall, I cannot recommend these shoes for anyone looking for a durable option. While they may be comfortable and stylish, they simply do not hold up to daily use. If you are looking for a shoe that will last, I would suggest looking elsewhere.",2,2023-09-27,United States

I love the shoes. They’re light, comfortable, and fit perfectly. However, the rubber on the balls of both feet have already worn flat and are close to having holes worn through. There are no other imperfections or signs of wear.

I wear the shoes daily, to include the gym and they’ve worked as well as I’d hoped, but not nearly as long.

The shoe is completely flat and impossible to run in, for myself anyway! I actually had the thought that this might be a good squat/deadlifting shoe however, with the elasticity of the upper body, I found my feet were moving too much regardless of how tight I laced it!

I ended up just using them for longer walks, found that I could literally feel the tiniest imperfections in my environment... Pebbles, twigs, cracks, you can feel it all. Might be great for a ninja, but I'd rather have the comfort and support!

R2J6OU3AYIR1X4,The sole of the shoe is very soft so it will grip well but will wear out quickly. I’ve had them a month and the tread is already 1/3 gone. They also act exactly like socks in the sense that they roll if you are standing on the side of a curb for example. I wanted to try these instead of Xero since I wanted to see how long they lasted in comparison but idk. The Xero were just a tiny bit more comfortable and these shed inside.

So I’m going to order a size 10 (my running shoe size in women’s sizes). My first thought was “is this like vanity sizing for men?” Lol.

RKQLES89U9MY5,"These are not true barefoot shoes. There is a curvature in the arch and It presses against your foot. The toe box curves upward and is not flat. If I want all of that, I'll just buy regular shoes. Do not recommend these if you are looking for zero drop/barefoot style shoes. I ordered multiple pairs of these and returned them all.",2,2023-12-02,United States
R29P9SY3KQKVAL,"This shoe is lightweight, and has a thinner soul than normal. However, it does not have a wide toebox, the heel is narrow so if you don't have a narrow heel, it feels awkward to wear. The soul curves up around the arch, so if you don't have a narrow foot, it feels awkward to wear.

Dont buy if you really want a minimalist/barefoot shoe. If you have a narrow foot, and want a lightweight shoe, it will be adequate.",2,2023-02-24,United States
R10GVHMND39MXQ,"2 things that have resulted in the low rating. First I wear a size 13 in theory that should translate to a size 47 per WHITIN sizing chart. They sent me a 46... I can cram my feet in and the fabric is stretchy enough for them not to really hurt for short periods. So I'm not bothering to send them back.
Secondly and most importantly in my opinion. These shoe have a tiny heal rise. Having been wearing some form of zero drop shoe for the last 4 plus years. That tiny little heal rise is almost so annoying that I can't ignore it. Which is weird because I have 2 pair of traditional hiking boots that I can wear all day without issue. But the itsy bitsy heal on these shoes drives me bonkers.",2,2021-03-30,United States
R1Q7058NBO94GT,"I loved these shoes. They were comfortable and slimline, not bulky. I was excited when I got them and they were really comfortable. I wore them non-stop for about two months. I was really upset when I went to pull the lace to tie them and the top eyelet on one shoe snapped. The area that the eyelet goes through is rubber and I can not figure out how to repair it. The eyelet is poorly reinforced. If you use these for active situations they will likely endure the name fate.",2,2022-12-04,United States
R2PNAJBJCPK16X,I find these shoes to be uncomfortable and cheaply made. They are very light weight. That might be their best quality. I wear them biking and they are good for that. Walking is the worst. The reason is the sole of this shoe is thin. You can feel every peeble and stone. The top of the shoe is fine. I found a niche use for them so I kept them.,2,2023-08-26,United States
REBVPI3D8CGL0,"You get what you pay for, I guess. Still too expensive. These feel just like $20 water shoes. They are cheaply made and are super uncomfortable to run in. They are also small in the toe box which is the opposite of what barefoot shoes should be.",2,2024-03-04,United States
R38ZLBSJYJ4EZ9,"I really wanted to like these. They were appropriately minimalist and zero drop and they fit just right. However, after only two days of jogging in them, the left shoe started to rotate sideways on my foot.. as in the big toe side of my foot started moving off the shoe-bed to the point where I was almost walking on the fabric part of the shoe. If I kept using them I am certain it would have rotated to the point where I WOULD have been on the fabric completely. I’m not sure if it’s just my gait or if I got a defective shoe, but that was my experience. The right shoe was fine.",2,2022-04-27,United States
R1NFQSCVCUEAEM,These shoes go on rotation weekly as a Barber. The string eyelet broke after tying them. I may have tied them 3 times since I have had them as they are stretchy enough to slip on and off. I don’t run or do any kind of abusive movements. I am just a Barber cutting hair in them all day. Sad they didn’t. It was one of 3 pairs I rotated everyday.,2,2023-06-06,United States

R28NPW2AL8083O,"These are not shoes - they're water shoes. The grip wears out quickly and the shoes are no where near the quality of competing shoes with zero drop.

R3AEIESIWV026T,"You get what you pay for. If it sounds too good to be true, its not. We've heard these sayings, and once again, this is true for these shoes. While the styling is good, the fit was only correct in the wide toe box. However everything else: The fit with socks, the fit without socks, even trying to get the shoe on, is far, far too small. If you do feel the need to order them; order two sizes bigger than what you wear.

The only other off-putting thing was that it was likely these have been returned prior to me getting them, because they came with no box, shrink-wrapped in plastic and tossed into a Amazon shipping bag. The only thing that made it convenient, was that it was bagged for return.",2,2021-09-29,United States
R11GXMQ9X20WPA,"I wear barefoot shoes for 8 years now. Mostly Vivobarefoot shoes, which are truly genuine barefoot shoes!!
The problem is that they are expensive !! Anyway tried these ones for the cost. As usually the reviews and ratings on amazon do not provide a realistic view of what they are calling a barefoot shoe. A shoe that comes with support is not a barefoot shoe !! Another thing to consider is that this shoe is extremely slippery on wet surfaces up to a point that it's really a hazard !! Bottom line, a cheap alternative that does not come close to the real deal, but you might keep it due to the low price. I hope my review can help real bearfooters",2,2021-10-10,United States

The larger size was ok-ish, but my toes were all the way to the tip of the shoe and the toe box was quite narrow.

It is better than modern shoes and the price is half that of other barefoot shoes, so if you are just looking to get into this stye of shoe or your budget is tight this might be an option for you. If that is the case, you should buy a wide shoe and a full size or two larger than your typical size.

Actually, makes the fit of these appear to be smaller than the actual size. I probably wouldn’t order these again from here. Also, can’t return because of the type of product.

R2LLJZFT20JLF1,I can’t understand why this product has such good reviews. I can only conclude people haven’t experienced comfortable underwear before.

R1JGVME5KKHWQ4,"I've been a loyal Hanes customer for a long time, but I won’t be purchasing this style again. The only reason I’m giving 2 stars instead of 1 is for the quality of the fabric itself. However, the waistband is severely lacking in elasticity.

If I had suspenders, I’d probably need them just to keep these briefs up! All six pairs have the same issue.

Unfortunately, I can’t return them since they've already been washed. They might work as rags, but I’m still deciding.

I can’t recommend these unless you don’t mind them sliding down as you walk. :(",2,2024-11-04,United States

R2K9OGX64L59BB,Not the best. First the positives. It's a name brand. Cheaper than buying at Walmart. Sizing is accurate. Now the negative.... Underwear started fraying at the wasteband after wearing and washing 3 times. Leg holes start out nice and snug around your legs but after 2 wearings the elastic is no longer snug.

R2N9C0TU785VGH,"Good old Hanes. Used to be a brand reliable for quality. Well, in their product description they say it “wicks away” moisture and has a new waistband that “adjusts to you.” Sounds good, but what does it mean? Well, after purchasing, I can tell you. “Wicks away” means the cloth is now so thin that it cannot absorb any moisture but just passes it along to your dress clothing. This is the opposite of why you wear underwear. The “adjusting” waistband? That means they are using less elastic and the waistband is less substantial.

R3LZ82D0QG6U2S,"I bought this watch exactly 2 years ago. For the price (about $15 at the time), it was not bad. There are a few quirks with the watch.

1. The watch reset itself once in a while (I think about 4-5 times in the past 2 years)
2. The light is not so great so it is hard to tell the time with the light on.
3. Hard to tell if it is on 24 or 12 hr time because the text is hard to read. I cannot tell if it says am/pm or 24 hr.
4. The wrist strap is starting to break (which is why I am on Amazon looking for another watch - not sure if it is worth the money to replace the strap).

R2LR0E4VY8ZBZN,"The watch seems to be built well. Plenty durable and, so far, haven't scratched up the face. Swapped the band right away, but that's just personal preference.

Not really keen on the display. It can be hard to read without angling it to the light just right. It also runs slow. I set it to the time clock at work and within a day or two, it's 5-15 seconds behind again. Isn't it's main function to keep time??

R5CF1YVQOM54Q,"I've had this watch for two years now. In general, everything about the watch itself works fine.

That being said, I actually prefer this watch over many others so replacing the band is worth it for me.

Still, in the last few months, I've found the face fogged up and now there's condensation inside the screen making it impossible to read the time. I bought it last Sept 2022; it didn't last a year. My only other gripe is the placement of the watch buttons. They are placed in a way that makes it very easy to jostle from work gloves or long sleeves.

The band doesn't bother me, it's comfortable and looks fine. It's the numbers on this watch that are SO dim, very difficult to see the time. And the backlight doesn't work well at all, it's very dim. My other complaint is trying to set the time/date, etc. is NOT easy. Read info, watched videos and still was not easy to set the buttons. Really shouldn't be so difficult for such a 'simple' watch. I don't think I'd buy this again because of its poor lighting and setup process.",3,2023-09-21,United States

Date, time, and everything is reset and I have to keep changing it to the correct time. The point of a watch is to tell time it's the one thing it should be good at why does it suck so much when the first one was so good and now my return window has closed and the resets are just getting more frequent it happened twice today. aaaaugh

old review: I've had this watch for about a year and except for some minor scratches has help up fantastically. I’ve used it in the shower and swimming with no problem. I have bone thin wrists but even with it’s large face it fit perfectly! Unlike other watches I’ve had, it had two bands to keep the excess band from hanging loose (A bigger thing than you’d expect). Keep in mind that the face is pretty large, however I have gotten way too many compliments on it. The large numbers would also be useful for someone with poor vision.
The only issues I’ve had is that the buttons don’t mean the usually things that they do on other digital watches so you’ll have to memorize a new setup. The brightness on the light is low but it’s never been an issue for me.",1,2024-04-19,United States

The second one I bought lasted less than a year too, when it started jumping to significantly different times randomly without touching any buttons.

And in a room that’s only slightly dim, you can’t read the numbering in the watch at all, unless you tap the little button that lights up the watch, but that too is very faint and only lasts for about 1 to 2 seconds before it turns off, leaving you with unreadable digits. I was so excited for this thing. I should have trusted the negative reviews who say the same thing.

If you take a picture of this watch with an iPhone or other smart phones, it will take a picture that presents the digits much brighter than they actually are in person. So I had to turn off the special effects on my iPhone to make sure the picture showed reality, but even the picture I’ve posted here, with my skin lit fairly well, actually shows the numbering in the watch brighter than they really are. In reality they are darker than they appear here, much less readable than they are as shown.

I don’t have time to mess around with Amazon returns. I’m in the hospital for 150 hours per week.",1,2022-04-30,United States
R2AV5FP37XWW8X,When I put this watch on my wrist to a comfortable position (it being tight enough) the end of the watchband stuck out on the side of my wrist (about an inch) and it looked very strange and was uncomfortable.

RQOMG9LPDOFA8,"Initially I loved the look of the watch. But soon after wearing it, the white band started to get discolored (shown), and I haven't been able to find a way to get it white again. It looks gross. You also have to have the the watch face pointing right at you to be able to read the time well. Again, I like the look of the watch, but the band is terrible quality, and I would not recommend it. Not the white band, anyway. So far it has resisted water well.

When I got out of the pool, however, I found that the waterproof ring had broken, and there was water vapor accumulation. Disappointed, I threw the watch away and got a new one. Not impressed.

It’s also very thick and not breathable. The band is more than half an inch thick and the plastic is heavy. I washed my hands a few times while wearing it and the water stayed underneath the band, had to remove to fully dry hours later. The watch is a bit bulky/clunky overall, so I found it very uncomfortable.

I appreciate that it has many features (including the nightlight) and says the day of the week on the face. Simple and straightforward, but overall not worth it.

Although my favorite part of watch is the faceplate, it tells you the day of the week with letters and numbers, digitally, the appearence is liked. I also like how the watch is reflective to see, when adjusted to sun, to check the time without covering with your hand.

I purchased it because I wanted an inexpensive watch for work to tell time at a glance without fishing my phone out of my pocket every time, and one that I would not be upset about scratching or bumping. For that purpose it works well, and the slim design is a bonus.

However, the pin that holds the wrist band inside the watch body has a nasty habit of popping out if you bend your wrist a certain way, or accidentally bump against something.

They fit like they are a size 10, my big toe hits the very end of the toe box, no wiggle room whatsoever. They are also extremely tight on the top of the foot and cut off circulation causing tingling and numbness in my toes within 10 minutes of just wearing them sitting down. The heel cup also doesn't even remotely cup properly, your heel will just slip up and down no matter how tight you sinch the laces. They also aren't as breathable as I thought they would be seeing as they are made of entirely of mesh. These shoes are an absolute joke.

R2OZQR6UC68ZNJ,"Pros:
Stylish Design: The shoes have a sleek and modern design that looks appealing.
Cons:
Poor Traction: The traction on these shoes is severely lacking. I found myself slipping on various surfaces, which was not only frustrating but also potentially dangerous.
Lack of Comfort: These shoes are incredibly uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. The lack of support and cushioning resulted in sore feet and discomfort.
No Arch Support: I also noticed a distinct lack of arch support, which exacerbated the discomfort and made walking in these shoes a painful experience.
Overall Impressions:
I was extremely disappointed with the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Despite their stylish appearance, they fail to deliver on crucial aspects such as traction and comfort. The lack of support and cushioning makes them unsuitable for extended wear, and the poor traction poses a safety risk.

---------
I purchases these walking shoes for our Japan vacation because of all the walking we're planning. Unfortunately, I had to throw these shoes away 2 days into our trip because the back of the shoe kept scraping my heels. I tried to put a bandaid against my heel but that was only temporary. I eventually just threw them out instead of bringing them back to return to Amazon.

They were comfortable for walking but that issue with scraping my heel just was so uncomfortable. I won't buy these again.

Unfortunately, I couldn't even return these as I didn't want to carry them back in our luggage.",3,2024-06-07,United States
R12BP0L8GW2N69,These look great but are not true to size. I bought the size 13s. These run a half inch narrow. You need to go up a size if you don't have a narrow foot,3,2024-12-18,United States
RJA8NWOYNFW58,"I usually wear a 12 in sneakers, so that's what I ordered. It arrived and felt too long and there was way too much space in the toe box causing my foot to slide around and the shoe to be uncomfortable and to feel like I had no traction walking across my wood floors. So I ordered a pair of size 11, the next size down. Those ended up being way too small and my toes were jammed up against the inside of the shoe and the heel and width were uncomfortable as well. I really need an 11.5 but they don't offer the shoe in that size, so I returned both. It's too bad, because I like the color and the overall design of the shoe. They are lightweight and would otherwise be comfortable, especially for spring / summer in Texas. Too bad they don't fit and don't offer a version that fits me proper.",3,2024-02-27,United States

R27E09I6M7AQB,"I purchased these shoes almost exactly 1 year ago and have worn them to work (office setting) daily. I wanted to start my review with that comment since it seems like most of the other reviews were written shortly after the shoes were purchased. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't trust reviews from people who have only worn these shoes for a few days. Allow me to give you the real scoop:

These shoes are made CHEAPLY. Nothing wrong with that, but just know they will not hold up like name brand shoes will. There's no such thing as a good deal, you're getting exactly what you're paying for. The soles of these shoes wear down very quickly and the tread becomes smooth and non-existent. This can quickly become a safety issue as the worn down tread makes wet floors feel like an ice skating rink.
Additionally, the fabric behind your heel will quickly wear out and rip (especially if you're slipping the shoes off and on frequently). I found the support to be lackluster and I ended up needing to insert a pair of orthotics.

They're cheap, easy to clean and look decent. However, I will not be buying these again and I'd recommend you avoid them unless you're deliberately looking for a super cheap, low quality shoe. Ignore the 5 star reviews, these are not anywhere near that caliber of shoe.",2,2024-03-31,United States
R2EVC85QOS9KMJ,Since they don’t offer half sizes I had to return. I wear a 10.5 but 11 was way too big and I had to return.

I guess it would straighten out over time and with wearing them.,3,2024-08-07,United States
If you're looking for something to wear for a few months,"I bought the grey - was needing a lite travel shoe for airports and cadual nightlife abroad. These looked great coming out of the box but after a try-on the heel was weak, and the soles very slippery, I can’t imagine on a wet surface or walking airport transfers.

R1OLDJWA9K7JKG,Overall love these shoes. Comfortable and good looking. But the tongue is either too thin or the lacing is not well designed but after half a day I am getting chafe spots on my foot due to pressure points.

R3VC5AU55RD4OY,"This is a straight out of the box impression, they have not been broken in. The rim around the sole is much more orange in person, it does not match the faux leather and makes the shoes look a little cheap. Reviews said to order down a size; I wear a 10 wide so I got a 9.5 standard. I have room in the toe but any smaller and they would have been very uncomfortable around the foot/heel so if you need wides, don't size down more than half a size if wide isn't available.Heel is very shallow, I can feel it pulling down as I walk, might break in over time.

R2MHH28JVG1PXG,"First off very light, breathable, stylish, and comfortable. My problems with the shoe are there is no arch support, no half sizes for 11.5, and not super great if u have thin ankles or narrow feet. The ankle area of the shoe is sort soft material and sorta wrinkles at the opening and and the laces are at max tightness in order to give me almost a snug fit (also had to wear a sock or they would be to loose). Also feel a slight pronation inward because they are so flat inside and have no arch, I never have problems with probation in other shoes. And after awhile standing in them I can feel pressure on my arch.",3,2023-07-23,United States

R183DHOA5F28NK,"I don't even know where to begin on these things. But I'll start with the biggest issue. The fit is absolutely terrible. I wear a size 10.5 in every other pair of boots, shoes, slippers etc that I own. All the reviews said these shoes fit perfectly. Well that's absolutely incorrect. They fit like they are a size 10, my big toe hits the very end of the toe box, no wiggle room whatsoever. They are also extremely tight on the top of the foot and cut off circulation causing tingling and numbness in my toes within 10 minutes of just wearing them sitting down. The heel cup also doesn't even remotely cup properly, your heel will just slip up and down no matter how tight you sinch the laces. They also aren't as breathable as I thought they would be seeing as they are made of entirely of mesh. These shoes are an absolute joke. Do not trust the 4 and 5 star reviews because that's what I did and now I'm out of $40. You're better off going to Walmart and getting a cheap pair of shoes there.

R37ID44XUE3NA9,"I usually wear a nine but they were too big. Comfortable though.

The 8 1/2 is still a little big but an 8 would be too small. It would be good enough, but I am returning them.

On the smaller pair, the right shoe has zero arch support. I already have feet problems, don't need more.

Most of the upper looks really nice, what doesn't is that nasty brown leather stripe up the back. So jarring and disgusting.

Just as bad is the side of the sole being white. Not only is white an ugly color and causes shoes to look filthy quickly, it clashes with the look of the upper - minus the nasty brown, which pitches in to ruin the look of the shoe.

There is very little traction. These are slippery on tile or wood floors.

I really don't like it when what I wear makes me look like I ride the short bus.

Even if the shoes were built properly, the nasty colors would still make me send them back.",2,2022-11-21,United States

R1VRR84P3OX8S3,"Pros:
Stylish Design: The shoes have a sleek and modern design that looks appealing.
Cons:
Poor Traction: The traction on these shoes is severely lacking. I found myself slipping on various surfaces, which was not only frustrating but also potentially dangerous.
Lack of Comfort: These shoes are incredibly uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. The lack of support and cushioning resulted in sore feet and discomfort.
No Arch Support: I also noticed a distinct lack of arch support, which exacerbated the discomfort and made walking in these shoes a painful experience.
Overall Impressions:
I was extremely disappointed with the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Despite their stylish appearance, they fail to deliver on crucial aspects such as traction and comfort. The lack of support and cushioning makes them unsuitable for extended wear, and the poor traction poses a safety risk.
Final Verdict:
I cannot recommend the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Their lack of traction, discomfort, and lack of support make them a poor choice for anyone looking for reliable and comfortable footwear.",1,2024-02-15,United States
R1JD38WLD13OCR,"The shoe looks good and fits nicely. Only one complaint: The rear shoe that should support your achilles is very soft and not at all firm enough. In fact, it will ride up and down slightly while walking. Not very good if your walking any distance (it's sure to produce soreness or blisters). Ok for errands or very casual wear.

I bought some arch support inserts and put them under the shoe inserts that came in the shoes. This helped but it's not the same as having native arch support built into the shoe. There is also an odd cushion at the base of the inside of the back of the shoe that makes them slip on your heel. If this cushion was placed higher up, it seems like the shoe wouldn't slip. I tried to add inserts that are supposed to keep the heel from slipping, but that didn't work.

- The soles are incredibly slippery on hard surfaces. Walking indoors on hardwood or tile floors, they feel just as slippery as my leather-soled dress shoes. I've already slipped once and had to catch myself on a chair. Walking shoes shouldn't be this slippery.

- When walking, my heel lifts up out of the shoe too much. The shoe doesn't fall off, I can definitely feel my heel lifting off the shoe a noticeable amount, and the back of my foot rubbing a little against the back of the shoe.

I have to try the product, as, due to ill health, I need it to check my Blood Pressure asap.

But this Omron displayed much lower readings, which I knew could not be true. This is because my partner was at the same GP appointment and had blood pressure read, so I tested her and both of our readings were far too low. I tried 3 times, and all 3 readings were wildly different. I've since purchased the Omron X3, which seems of better quality build and has given me consistent accurate readings. It also has the ability for 2 users. I'd recently discovered my blood pressure was creeping up and ordered this unit as I wanted to monitor it as I tried to change my diet.

Had a problem locating the screw for the 5th leg into it's nut as  with the leg fully pushed on it wasn't quite in line enough. Had to force the nut through the plastic surround. It took me about 30 minutes and the only tool required was a small hammer to push the plastic screw covers fully on as they were a bit tight.The final product looks good but can't judge longevity as I have only just received it.

Seemingly reliable & consistent with its reading  everytime it is usedEasy to clean and change batteries.Everyone should learn how to take a blood pressure manually though and not rely on wholly inaccurate & highly variable machines to do the job.Packs tidily away into a little draw string bag and is small enough to fit in any first aid bag/box/cupboard and is aesthetically pleasantly pleasing in its design though this is not an important quality which is needed.(Edit was a correct typos)",3,2024-09-13,United Kingdom

Most adjustable desks in the market cannot go as low as is optimal for my height. This is one of the very few I’ve found that can do that and was relatively inexpensive for a desk this size with moving parts. That said, the desk will often stop while you’re holding the button down and start going in the opposite direction even if it crushes you or whatever is underneath it or pulls wires further than they should go. You have to play with it a bit to get it to work right. Keep in mind it’s also very heavy and difficult to put together for yourself.

R145ME4R5UHQGV,"Assembled this today and the instructions are just bad.1. Product Description should clearly state that you need a screw driver or a drill.2. There is a crossbar that runs from one leg of the table to the other leg. This crossbar comes shortened and you have to loosen the nuts holding it and extend the crossbar.a) They never tell you how far to extend it (you don't know because you don't know the distance between the legs of the table)b) They also don't tell you that after extending it, you shouldn't tighten the screws firmly immediatelyNote: The correct step isi) Pull the right hand side of the crossbar. There 's a small red arrow/text which says 'max'. This means don't extend the right hand side beyond that point.ii) After pulling (extending the crossbar), don't tighten the screws. Keep it just tight enough that the crossbar doesn't fall apart.iii) When you finally lay the table top flat (upside down on the ground), you'll position one leg of the table on the holes on one edge of the flat top. Then you slowly drag the second leg towards the holes on the other edge of the table (since you didn't tighten the screws of the crossbar, the crossbar now slowly gets stretched to the right width/position)3) The table requires 2 screws in the middle. The screws are provided but no holes are pre-drilled. You're expected to drill the holes yourself (I assembled mine without drilling the holes; plan to add them later and then add the screws)4) Someone else mentioned this and I noticed it during the assembly - the table smudges easily.

The only positive was the quick shipping. I ordered on 3/7, received the package by 3/9, even started setting it up as soon as it arrived.Immediately opened the package, nothing looked broken or missing. Once the whole desk was put together & plugged in, it was time to do the manual reset as instructed. Held the up and down arrow buttons for a few seconds, then one leg went up a bit, back down and then the other leg did the same thing. After research, that’s not suppose to happen. Tried raising the desk and no luck. After more research, I thought maybe I had put it together incorrectly so I took everything apart, put it back together according to instructions, still no luck. Then again for the 3rd time. Tried contacting the sellers customer service for help, no help. Then the sellers website, which did not have troubleshooting for my model of desk. So then I took the desk apart for the last time and boxed it all back ready to return it. This took me almost 9 hours from putting together for the 1st time to calling it quits and boxing it all back up at 12 am.Since I could not get in contact with the seller, I called Amazon CS. They stated they could message the seller who had 48 hours to respond. The seller answered back next day and wanted me to troubleshoot the same things I did days before. It should not be this hard to return an item if it arrives defective. After days of back & forth messages the seller was absolutely no help. Went back to Amazon & filed the A-to-Z guarantee. This guarantees that since the desk came broken I could send it back and receive the refund. *Disclaimer- if you try to return the item, the seller doesn’t cover shipping, that’s on you.Followed the Amazon Claims instructions and went to the post office & spent $96 to ship the package. If you have to do this, make sure to have someone sign at delivery once the package is received for your records. Also, keep the post office receipt and upload to your Amazon claim page in the app.The package delivered a few days later, Amazon stated to wait 72 hours to receive the refund back from the seller. 72 hours went by and no refund. Contacted Amazon again w/ the evidence from the USPS website showing the package was delivered. Amazon immediately issued a refund. Then, also refunded the shipping costs. So kudos to Amazon for being so helpful!I purely bought this desk because 1)it was affordable and 2) it looked of good quality. So some advice, please look at ALL of the reviews, good and bad so you don’t have to go through the headache of what I had to go through & don’t buy an item just solely based on the low price. Definitely do your research! Hope this helps the next person!",1,2025-04-04,United States
R1649F49YPVJJW,"Pros:-Lighweight and easy to manouvreCopes with long grass pretty wellCons:-This machine has the most tangle-prone power cable I've ever come across. Even when it's stored carefully away after use, it still manages to twist itself into an unfeasibly convoluted mess every single time. I'm tempted to set up a trail cam in my shed to see if it's haunted.After one season the mower started to cut out intermittently.

R164U5MO60PGZM,"In an effort to be more environmental and to save my back, I bought the Greenworks battery operated mower. Firstly the battery lasts approx 20 to 30 mins.  As it powers down from about 15 minutes into the operation the mower becomes more erratic.  It does not have the power to throw the cut grass into the grass bin and so keeps stopping and you have to lift the lid to push the grass back by hand.  It leaves clods of grass on the lawn and this then needs to be raked but still remains an untidy finish.  Of the 5 cutting levels, the lowest churns up the lawn and the next up is too low for the battery strength although I get round this by doing a first cut on the middle height followed by the next one down. This uses both batteries so its just as well that two batteries are supplied and that they recharge fairly quick.",2,2021-08-02,United Kingdom

R16SHT13WEFGEG,"Initial setup was fast, so the problems started straight away.. first, screen starts glitching on the menu and when trying to play anything, so after around an hour reading online how to fix and about 10 restarts trying different settings, i found a forum which mentions lowering the frame rate - it was set to auto (60hz) which is what my tv is capable of, but i manually lowered it to 50hz just incase that might help - it did..So i start watching a movie and a few minutes into watching, the audio cuts out completely.. i reset everything and the same thing happens again around 10mins after watching, it happens a number of times again before I finally get the audio to stay on through trial and error.. this also took around 1hr to fix.Finally the screen has stopped glitching and the audio is on, i get half way through my movie and the audio goes completely out of sync..  so i again research online why it just decided to go out of sync and look at how to fix it, i spend another half and hour trying to find a solution online and try to sync the AV up in settings by matching the sound in time with a ball bouncing (easy enough), click “apply”, go back to the movie and its still bot synced together!!

R16TBBOAZXWS54,"First words that comes to mind regarding the materials and quality: cheap, average, lacklusterI ordered the 55” x 28” version of this item that includes a white frame + maple particle board top (btw, I thought I had ordered the bamboo top but hence got the cheaper particle board mess). The actual model is E4W (not the E7, as I expected). This was marketed as being heavily discounted during the most recent Prime day in 2023.The only capability I can see with this is an anti-collision feature which prevents the desk from crushing whatever is beneath the table (if lowering), or pressing up against (if raising).Pros:+ ease of assembly+ frame and top ship separately,+ packaging is good, keeps things protected,+ table has rounded corners,+ good stability when raised to ~48”,+ good range that can go below 25”,+ electric motors operation is smooth and quiet,Cons:- no cable tray management for wires underneath,- frame to top mounts uses self tapping screws (basically when used with particle board, it’s a one time drill in)- pre drilled holes aren’t the best alignment: expect to drill holes yourself where the prescribed ones should have worked (I had to finesse the frame mount alignment to pre drilled holes, they were off by 1/8”)- marketing makes you think you’re getting a E7, but in reality it’s just a lower tier E4- cheap ac/dc adapter (think a small laptop) with limited length of wiring to the brain- cheap metal holder for the ac/dc adapter- questionable if this holds up to intended weight and load rating based on the quality of parts (item description says it’s rated at up to 287 lbs total; but the framendocumentation says it’s 220 lbs)For a “pro” level desk; it does not come with any cable management tray as seen as with other desks. Don’t be fooled by the marketing. Actually, this is a basic desk with minimal features. All in all, IMO this desk is not worth anything over $200, It would have been better off getting a used Haworth or commercial desk (found in the workplace).",3,2023-08-10,United States

R173K6NPQL9HAH,"I brought this set of charging leads specifically because it mentions and shows pictures of their “Bionic Tail Joint” that “Never Breaks”, giving a 45,000+ bend lifespan. These images clearly show the joint flexing and so protecting the cable. Yet on receipt of the product it is clear this is absolute rubbish as the joint/glands are so stiff that they have no give in them whatsoever. This will result in the cables simply breaking where they enter the gland like any other cable.It is a shame as the connectors seem of reasonable quality and the braided cable seems better quality than many others I have bought, but this is let down by what I mentioned above.Time will tell how long they last and I will update my review as and when I have more news to report.UPDATE: Sunday 10th July 2022.On 4th July I received an email from the supplier asking for my address saying they “would like to send you a upgraded version for another try”, and during the week a pack of 2 x 2m cables turned up. Whether they are better than the originals sent remains to be seen, as in all honesty the “Bionic Tail Joints” of the 2 replacement cables sent don’t seem a great deal more flexible than the originals.Today they’ve emailed me again asking if I had received the replacements, also asking me to change my review. However, I ordered a box of 5 so sending only 2 possibly better cables doesn’t really cut it as far as I am concerned. I’ve replied to that email explaining honestly that sending 2 supposedly better cables does not warrant changing my review, but that I would add an update…which I have now done.",2,2022-06-19,United Kingdom

I went through the troubleshooting and nothing worked as I couldnt pinpoint where the problem was - whether it was a faulty remote or firestick. I borrowed a remote from a friend and it worked straight away thereby identifying the error.The remote came supplied with suppliers batteries. Replacing the batteries did not help either as the blue led indicator light did not illuminate. I tried adding the remote from the ""add new remote"" screen but was unsuccessful. I swapped batteries between the remotes to see if the batteries were the issue but that also failed.The best thing I can say about the firestick is that you can use the firestick app instead of the remote which is a bonus, otherwise I would have had to pay an extra £22 just for a firestick remote - the app is useless if you cant get past the initial set up screen to add the remote and set up the wifi connection.This is not the standard I was expecting.Wil update when required.",1,2024-07-18,United Kingdom
R17AYC3VG0G84R,"Well I had to calm myself down for three hours before writing my review. Otherwise it would have been full of bad language, rage and bile and that would have not been fair on anyone. Ok here I go. I brought this machine as my other one, not a Karcher, was starting to die on me after many years of service. I decided, after everyone kept on telling me how amazing Karcher was and how fantastic they were. So I took the plunge. Putting it together was ok, except for clicking in the hoses, but it was all put together in about ten minutes. Then we come to using it! As a powerful jet washer, it did the job. My grief I had while using it was it constantly fell over with a crash, with just the slightest movement of the hose. The hose itself was always trying to form a coil and tangle itself, again making the machine fall over. The constant worrying about the bloody thing, sorry, falling over, made the whole job of cleaning the car a miserable experience. It should be a happy event when you car is nice an shiny, not a thank fudge that's done labour. Stowing the hoses leads and lances on the machine, again caused it to fall over. Even standing in the garage now all is done, I've gone to check on it like it's a nervous new pet! If I getup tomorrow and it's fallen over, I will not be surprised. So I must say on power and cleaning, of a car, it did well, but did I enjoy using it, no. Maybe when it's been used a few times and the hoses loose some of their stiffness it will be better, but I still think the whole unsalability of the unit will be there. It was a good price. It was delivered on time and undamaged. Sorry for rambling on, but wanted to be fair. x",3,2023-05-10,United Kingdom

I have been using it semi regularly since I bought it in October but now about 7 months later the power cable has decided to stop working so I have to use batteries. On the one hand it's good that there is option to power it with batteries, however, now it's going to increase the cost of using it due to the added cost of having to buy batteries. This is the only reason I've given 3 stars. If I could continue using it without having to buy batteries I would give 4.5 stars. The last 0.5 star is taken off due to the provided cable being too short, if it was longer I'd give 5 stars. Overall a very good BP machine to use at home if you need to monitor your BP.

R17U4TLCWIXA12,"I’ve had this height adjustable desk for about seven months now, and unfortunately, what started out as a promising product has turned into a frustrating daily experience.At first, it seemed fine. The height adjustment was smooth, and I was excited about finally having a standing desk. But after just a few months, I began to notice some wobbling whenever I adjusted the height. Fast forward to now — it's significantly worse. The desk shakes noticeably during adjustments and even while typing or leaning slightly on it. It’s gone from a minor annoyance to a full-on distraction.Stability should be a top priority in a desk like this, especially one meant for ergonomic use and long hours. Instead, it feels like the internal mechanism or frame has gradually weakened over time. I haven’t overloaded it, and it’s only been used for basic home office tasks (monitor, laptop, keyboard), so I can’t chalk it up to heavy use either.For the price, I expected much better durability and build quality. I now find myself reluctant to adjust the height at all, which completely defeats the purpose of having a sit-stand desk in the first place.Pros:Easy to assembleInitially smooth height transitionsCons:Becomes unstable over timeShakes during use and adjustmentPoor long-term build qualityWould not recommend if you’re looking for something sturdy and reliable.

R18IDLGV111CGG,The build quality of this desk is questionable to say the least. I initially assembled it and set it up and it work for a couple of weeks (saying that I didn’t have a need to adjust the height after the initial adjustment so essentially it worked once). I bought a new chair and tried to adjust it but nothing worked. I reset it and it automatically started descending and stopped when I pressed the button. It wouldn’t rise or descend after resetting. Support was reasonable but nothing they asked me to do worked. They are supposed to be shipping a new motor but I have little confidence now in this piece of kit and wished I had of just bought one from Ikea.,1,2025-01-02,United Kingdom

R18MFDJKRFMY2Y,"I had heard good things about this standing desk in a handful of forums as well as reviews on amazon, so I decided to give it a shot.The positives I can give about this desk is that it was delivered promptly and it appears to be sturdy.  However, that’s where the positives end.Upon opening the box some pieces had some scuff marks and scratches. I don’t think this was a pre-used item, I think this may have come from the factory, which is not great quality control.Some of the instructions were ambiguous for a number of reasons. One being that the images some times didn’t have the correct orientation and when there was a close up shot, it covered the position of where the item should go.  In addition, some items were labeled incorrectly (e.g. there were two different screws in two different steps labeled “B”) or there were items that were labeled (e.g. 9 & 14) but there is no 9 or 14. Even if there were, why switch from letters to numbers?Also, some words used in the instructions were not grammatically correct, which makes me believe that the instructions were created by coping and pasting into a translator app.   Of course, you can use context clues to figure out the situation, but you should not need to.The instructions also had instructions for screwing in items in places that had no holes in them, which is confusing and again not a good look for quality control.Upon completing the build, it appears to be sturdy but the motor that drives the riser is a bit slow compared to other standing desks I have used. It just feels like it’s rather weak and on its final legs in comparison.  So in short, it works but my only question is for how long. This ambiguity and quality control issues makes it hard to recommend to others.",3,2024-12-28,United States

R193GGLX13HBI2,"To be fair, I don't usually buy this kind of speaker. I find that small drivers voiced to put out more bass than they can actually manage, can end up sounding quite ridiculous. I've tried a few cheap speakers and they never work out well, so I wasn't expecting much. I expect vocal clarity and intelligibility to be the first goal of any speaker designer, and these don't do that. They are muffled and boxy, with a very high emphasis on bass output.As you can see for the video, the enclosure is so light that it starts rotating when the bass hits, so even that didn't work out well.  This is connected to a pro interface with +4dBu output, hence there's no capping of the bass transient. No EQ was used. With onboard sound or a USB DAC I'm unable to reach this level. The speaker is fed from a 5V, 3A power supply - using a motherboard's USB-C sees distortion set in a lot earlier. I measured the usable output level at 80dB at 2 feet for music, maybe a bit higher for compressed modern pop music and then a little more for internet video. You'd just be able to get 85-88dB max if you're sitting close up.When using the USB-C of the motherboard (and, I'm assuming, a USB-C PD charger), there's no apparent way to shift the speaker to low gain mode. When using the external supply the difference between the modes is quite apparent. The High mode sacrifices some more of the already poor fidelity, making the treble more peaky and the enclosure rotates a little earlier.The wires are extremely short. I can barely get it on either side of a 30"" monitor and have to get creative (no pun intended) to get the right placement. I needed a basic speaker to cover one PC's audio output till the pandemic situation ended, and needed something a little better than the R12U I was using earlier. This is fine for that.This is my fourth cheap Chinese product, and they are all terrible. The sound processing employed by all of them ruins the sound and if you never heard a good speaker you'd think it is okay, but it's not. Creative tried to get a tiny 1.5"" driver (it's not 2"") to sound big and it just ends up confused. You can just about make out the vocal section, and the bass is boxy and just sounds cheap.One caveat though, when running speech and Youtube videos off cheap motherboard audio it sounds acceptable. It's only when connected to a proper source and playing music with proper transients, that you can tell it's junk. For my intended application it'll work, but don't be misled by the positive feedback. You are never going to get more than you are paying for it.",3,2023-12-13,India

Cant say it really does at all.  Its more of a pepper spice in the front like a lot of pepper colognes were doing for a while.  That mellows out some to a sweeter vibe, sorta like spicy baby powder.

You take your time you send pictures you remeasure they confirm you did everything right and proceeded to tell you to drill your own holes.

R1D9QX8SDZ2DU8,"""As for the cable length, we've heard you! Pebble V2 now has a longer cable connecting the right to left satellite speakers without sacrificing audio quality for the best audio experience.""I'm not sure that Creative heard anyone on this, having increased the cable length by a meagre 15cm, from 1.2m to 1.35m. This extra 15cm still won't help anyone with even a relatively short 1.4m desk. The speaker-to-speaker cable is also fixed at both ends, meaning you can't integrate it into many cable management systems or extend it. The power and audio jack cables are also very short at 1.2m but at least they can be extended via other cables (sold separately).The speakers look nice enough and have helped to de-clutter my desk, replacing my old Creative GigaWorks T20 behemoths. Sound is fine for someone like me who mostly uses headphones and just wants something functional for the rare occasion where I have to play something out loud.Line in and headphone out sockets would be nice but I appreciate it's not a key feature for such cheap, small speakers.

R1DZ82OQ5DLQ1E,I bought this machine based on the Karcher name Believing that Karcher products are robust and fit for use! It was by no means a cheap option for me.The quality of the body of machine is made.of very thin cheap plastic The area where the handle slips into has no clips or way of securing the handle. So could easily slide out while carrying the machine and I suspect one fall could very easily crack the body of the machine. Also I've not been able to use the machine be cause karcher do not include the proper hose fittings so now I have to hunt down the fittings! I'm very disappointed not only with karcher but amazon too..the instructions with the machine expressly state NEver to use hose coupling with Aquastop on the water connection of the device! Page 7 on instruction leaflet....yet they sell this very Aquastop under the Karcher name on Amazon! I noted this from another reviewer the connector itself had literally fallen. To bits. He provided pictures of thw nightmare connector..I do not have high hopes for this machine and do not want anyone else to pay good money for a device which begins to disappoint once everything is unboxed.

R1GA8N6PAFU8AX,"The overall three stars: After receiving and very carefully putting the desk together using padding at all point, I noticed dents in the desktop, as well as a chip on a corner. The dents are square- or star-shaped, like a Phillips screwdriver was tapped onto the surface, and the chip is a decently big one that I didn't create. At this price point, and for the size of the packing materials (that of course I threw away before I saw the flaws the next day in sunlight), I expect better when the product is new. Let me ding it up myself, down the line....As for the rest, I wanted to leave a review specifically for people who are smaller and not as strong, because receiving and putting together your own furniture can be quite a task.Box: The box is a big one; you'll likely need to turn it sideways--that is, not along its widest edge--to get it through an average door. Keep this in mind if you're using a dolly. At over 80 pounds, you can probably slide the box along the floor on its own over carpet, or with a towel over tile or similar. There are no extra straps to grasp, which I generally take as a good thing, but getting the box up stairs could be an issue, unless you do a wrap and drag thing with a blanket and have the strength. Of course, it's always an option to open the box and take pieces upstairs individually, but the individual pieces are heavy and apparently pretty fragile, so I'd recommend NOT unboxing before you're ready to build, if you can. The box itself is two pieces, so that's a help; once you cut through the small amount of tape, you're in. There's somewhat unfortunately not a lot of protective styrofoam inside--not a phrase I'm used to saying, but I think that would have helped here.Assembly: The two biggest pieces are inside large plastic sacks, so you can use these to slide out the desktop and the legs. Watch out for the drawer to open. I moved a piece of tape on the bottom on the desk over to hold this closed. The desktop is the heaviest piece, so have a blanket or towels ready to go, both to protect the desk and your floor and to help you turn over the desk later. Next, the legs are all one piece, and--best part--they fit upright, or upside down, against the upside-down desktop in such a way that you don't have to hold them in place or put the whole thing in a corner for support while you screw in a couple of bolts (the wrench is included--no need for your own tools). Then, the two feet get attached; if you're adding anything like a felt pad or swapping out for the casters, do that before you attach the feet to the desk. There are a couple of things to plug in, and you'll see that in the instructions. I recommend doing that while it's all still upside-down. That's it! It's pretty quick. For strength and strain, moving the box, pulling out the desktop, pulling out the legs piece, and turning the whole thing over once assembled are all of the big lifts. The last will be easiest if you don't use the separately purchased casters, but I found them strong enough to make it over the turn, with a little lifting.Features: I was most interested in the drawer, which I didn't see on other standing desks, as that keeps clutter out of sight. It could be bigger, but I won't knock it, in that beggars can't be choosers way. Having the USB ports on the corner is great for charging devices, and I haven't had any problems raising or lowering the desk, and with the added casters (on a hard-surface floor), I can quickly turn from looking out the window to where I have a meetings-friendly backdrop, move the desk for cleaning, etc. I added a hanging cord organization basket, as this doesn't have one of its own, and...well, it could, as could most desks. I'll probably add a headphones hook at some point, and I'd love to have some adjustable, floor-level but movable basket for a desktop computer, though mine is light and the desk doesn't seem to have any issues with it, a monitor, and other computers, speakers, and a lamp. I haven't tried out the presets yet, but it's good to know that with one touch, I can adjust the height to one I've already tried and found ergonomic.",2,2022-07-05,United States

R1GJNQFQN2E8Z6,"I don't want to be overly harsh as it's in the cheap price range but I feel picking this mower wasn't my finest moment. It arrived quickly and despite other reviews it went together easily. It folds back down nicely to fit in a small car. The cuttings box has decent cubic volume as is easy to remove and reattach. Blade cutting width is good for a cheap electric mower and the depth lever is in an OK place to use. So far so good. However when using the depth control its hard to know what depth you've chosen. The wheels are a very cheap setup and there is far to much play on them which does make straight lines tricky. Unlike cheap qualcast mowers (that also have no rollers) this mower doesn't leave stripes. All in all there's nothing wrong with this mower, I've just had better for similar money",3,2021-12-29,United Kingdom

R1H242OSKBSDPL,"So I've actually bought one of these cables before, and I liked it so much I got a three pack. Now due to my own lack of diligence I believed it was a three pack of the same length, when it was a mixture of lengths. But that's my fault, I don't fault them for it, it is clearly explained if you look.Seeing as I didn't need a short cable I gave it away to someone as soon as I realised it was short. That's going to be an issue shortly. So I went to use the cable for the first time today and when I plugged it in I noticed the light on it was much dimmer than the light on on my existing older cable. Like, so dull it's hard to notice. I plugged my phone in and it gained 1% over the span of 40 mins, on standby on my desk.So obviously the cable is defective, and you may say, well just return it and get a replacement. But I can't do that because I gave one of the cables away. In the end it doesn't function as expected, it doesn't handshake fast charging, and it's so slow it's basically useless.Frustrated is not the word. (To be clear, my first cable was good, good enough to make me buy another set. But just make sure you check all the cables work as expected before giving one away.)",1,2024-09-11,United Kingdom

R1H9XRP0UC3EH6,I bought this almost a year ago but have only just started to use as was asked by surgery to record blood pressure twice a day for a week due to having high blood lressure. Sometimes it gives a reading of 102/60:or similar and then 5 minutes later 140/62 but reading taken by nurse (at my home using her monitor) was 161/75. When this is used on myself it doesn’t usually pump up to more than 140 before counting down. I don’t feel I can trust it to be a true indication of what my BP really is. I previously had a monitor with a wrist strap and got a more consistent reading with that.,1,2024-10-19,United Kingdom

We bought this desk on Amazon based on its reviews, but as I said at the beginning, cheap ends up expensive!The desk is very nice, the size is great, and it's easy to assemble. However, the seller and customer service aren't very efficient. They’re friendly but not efficient.The mechanism that raises the desk doesn’t work, so I contacted the seller and told them that I was happy to keep the desk but asked them to send me a replacement for the damaged item. Videos, photos, emails, more videos, more photos, more emails… and five days later, despite all the evidence I've sent, they still haven't agreed to send the replacement. On top of that, they respond to emails in the middle of the night (UK time), and when I reply in the morning, I don't get a response until 3 or 4 a.m. the next day. It's frustrating.Since I got tired of all the back-and-forth emails, I decided to proceed with the return. Guess what? I have to pay for the shipping costs! And I’m not returning a 2 kg package but probably something weighing 10 kg or more. This makes me wonder, is it even worth returning it? How much am I going to have to pay?

They're not just a little bit off. With my old cuff I'm getting readings of around 116/78 which is what the hospital is getting but with the cuff that came with it I'm getting readings of 158/94...

Again, as a spare monitor for work that's not an issue. But it feels cheap.When I turned it on, there was some discolouration on the left hand side and when I looked at it, the left hand side of the screen is curved whilst the right hand side is straight. Can't tell if it's a manufacturing fault or the way it's been handled to get to me. But it means the screen is warped.Tried to turn it off with the remote, and the light flickers indicating a signal but the TV stays on. All other remote functions appear to work. A quick Google indicates that this might be a common issue.All in all it's a cheap TV that'll be used for work only, but if I'd bought it for use as an actual TV I'd be asking for my money back and paying the extra for a better made one.Updated review after 6 weeks. TV randomly switches from HDMI1 to HDMI2, even if only one has a cable in.

I paid £59.99 in total. In the past, at the very start when Amazon first released the Fire Stick, I used it for a very short period of time. However, this time, I wanted to use IPTV on my LG home TV. Since it was not possible to install OTT TV on the LG TV, I started to research how I can start using the application. Later, I was veryupset to learn that the Firsetick cannot be used for this specific IPTV app, and I left it. As a result, the firestick is useless to me. It is a good device, however, I do not need it for waht is has to offer. Earlier, today, I found out that I can send the purchase back to Amazon and get a full refund. But I just found out that I as eligle for a refund only for a month from the day of buying it.

R1N8YEESQVFNWJ,"I'm not one to usually leave a review, but I bought this as I moved to a new house. I was really excited as I've been wanting a standing desk for a while, but obviously with moving and xmas I had to go for a more budget option. The size is good! It looks great, I won't lie. However I found that there are quite a few problemsOne The actual functionality of it. I've not used it as often as I'd've liked as I have gotten an office job. However the buttons don't tend to work. I set the two heights I would like and it just will not move most the time. Sometimes it will work if I unplug it and replug it, but for the most part it remains stationary at the one height. If I press the two buttons to reset it to factory mode it will go down, but I cannot get it to standing height! Additionally the motor is VERY loud, and quite annoying.Finally despite the wood looking good, and the size being nice, I wouldn't say it's the most stable. I can see everything shaking when the height changes (if I can even get it to change at all)All and all I would probably recommend possibly getting a different model, as I've only had this desk about 3 months, and have scarcely used it for it to be this dysfunctional (If I used it constantly maybe I'd understand the lag a bit better but again, I've not used it nearly as much as I would have liked to)",2,2025-04-01,United Kingdom

I have my last grass cutter for over 20 years without any breakages or hassle at all.  Over £100 spent, no help from Amazon and now very long grass! A very disatisfied customer!

R1OYUNWR46SKV,"First off, the lumbar support is not as adjustable or effective as I had hoped. It feels too hard and doesn’t really support my lower back the way I need it to, which leads to discomfort after a few hours of sitting. The adjustable headrest is also not great—it's either too low or too high, and I can't seem to find a comfortable position. The armrests, though flip-up, feel flimsy and don’t stay in place when I try to adjust them, which is frustrating.I wish I had spent a little more on a higher-quality chair. The Naspaluro Office Desk Chair does the job in terms of being functional, but it doesn’t live up to its ergonomic promises or the comfort I expected. If you’re on a tight budget, it might work for short, occasional use, but if you need a chair for long hours at the desk, I would recommend looking elsewhere.",2,2024-11-11,United Kingdom
R1P0RGFXZFVXHC,"I purchased the INIU USB C Charger Cable based on its description, which claimed it supports fast data synchronisation up to 485Mbps, allowing for quick transfer of movies, files, and songs. However, I found this to be untrue. I initially bought this cable to use as an alternative to my Xbox controller cable, needing a long cable. Based on the description, I thought the data transfer speed would be sufficient for my Xbox controller, but it simply won't detect it and instead just charges it.Next, I tested the cable with my phone for data transfer, and the data transfer speed was extremely slow—it would take ages to transfer anything. Initially, I thought the cable might be faulty, so I ordered another one and encountered the same result. It did not work for data transfer and wouldn't function with my Xbox controller at all.On the positive side, the cable quality is good, and the charging speed support is satisfactory. If you have no issue with data transfer, then this cable is a decent choice for charging your devices with high-speed chargers. However, if you need a cable for data transfer, I would not recommend this product due to its slow data transfer speed and incompatibility with my Xbox controller.",2,2025-02-18,United Kingdom

I've tried changing the settings including the noise reduction settings but it hasn't changed. I will replace this TV later in the year. Before connecting to the PC I tried the tv tuner. It only tuned in 35 tv channels from freeview. That's 70 channels it couldn't find. I usually opt for TV's as they are usually brighter than monitors and have speakers but this one has been a let down. Probably ideal for a bedroom/kitchen tv.",2,2025-03-22,United Kingdom

R1PTSGU74XPXHZ,"I guess the overall positive reviews of this product are in relation to the low price. In which case i can't blame them. For the price, these are good speakers for some generic use like playing yt videos and such.You will definitely not enjoy music on these though. The sound is pretty muffled and audio separation is bad. They are quite loud for the size but then again im not sure why other reviewers on amazon claim the sound doesn't get distorted, because it definitely does get distorted when you put the volume high.If you want to enjoy music look elsewhere and be prepared to spend more money. If you're looking for a generic use set of speakers on a budget get these but have moderate and realistic expectations.",3,2023-08-10,United Kingdom

It digs in to the grass, needs emptying multiple times and doesn’t seem to cut well either. The bottle of my back is now aching. I’ve started a return on Amazon, I was hoping for a lightweight mower to effortlessly cut the small lawn but this doesn’t fit any of my criteria.

The 4 containers of wipes all had a small hole in the top and 1 had the seal burst at the side. I complained as without the liquid in the containers the wipes will dry out. I was advised that all containers do come with a hole in them but that would only cause a problem if the courier kept them upside down for a while. I was also told the courier would not provide a refund unless I had photographic proof to show the containers had been damaged.

The postman even commented that there was no power with it as he passed by.Then one of the nozzles on the spinner inside the brush head stopped working less than five minutes after its first use. It wasn't blocked, just useless.This is a cheap, lightweight futile device that will make your cleanup task much longer, if it makes it to the end without a defect. Simply underpowered.If you tug the hose at all the device falls over as it had no weight to it.I have a Karcher K7.91 and it still works after about 10 years.

It's only as good as it's accuracy, and frankly this is way off! Choose a different brand folks. * UPDATE: Contacted the Omron Company asking for an explanation.

R1UUN7TGEL2Y2L,"I'll just list my top 4 issues with this bamboo desk -1) Product drawing conveniently leaves out the thickness of the top board.. I hoped it was at least 3/4th inch.. turned out to be a skinny 1/2inch! Disappointing.2) The top board is NOT a single piece!! It's 2 pieces  that you have to join with wooden dowel pins and brackets.. you are left with an unnecessary groove where dirt and things gather. Not shown in the product drawing clearly either!3) Edge is not rounded with a proper radius to avoid it from digging in to the under side of your forearm if you're sitting slightly lower to be able to look straight at your laptop screen. In a few mins you feel the edge biting you. Why not make a larger radius all the way around??4) Thin guage metal brackets provided for the drawer and battery holder are so flimsy, if you bend it the wrong way by mistake and then bend it the right way.. you have ruined your bracket for good! Why not stamp these brackets to shape without the perforations that make them so weak?This product could be so much better!

R1V2L9IVC9TFUH,"For the price I expected better finish on the desktop. My other bamboo standing desk, that my wife now uses, was $150 cheaper than this one. This is the one I will  be comparing it to. It had a much nicer finish to the desk top section.I bought this because of how low it goes. It is replacing another sanding desk.  Range height is great. Raising it is smooth and sturdy. My desk has the curve in it.Assembly isn't to bad, just get it as square as possible at the start. However,  I had to do a little drilling since the center rail bracket holes, didn't have any holes. Also had to drill holes for the power pack. The instructions do not tell you to drill holes, but I wouldn't put a screw in wood without drilling a pilot hole.What I really don't like is the beveled edge of the desk is sharper than is should be in some areas. Very inconsistent edge around the table top. I'm going to have to take some high grit sandpaper to knock the edge off. Bad thing is that it's right in the curve where I sit. Hoping I can take the edge off without damaging the overall finish.Next is the cable management holes. Those are even sharper edge with no bevel at all. I didn't realize this desk didn't come with covers for those holes. Guess I'll need to buy them. My cheaper desk came with covers.  Again for the price, they couldn't toss them in.Next thing I don't like is that table top finish, very grainy feeling. The coating on it isn't enough to make it feel flat/smooth. My cheaper desk, also has bamboo top but has a nice smooth finish. This doesn't impact functionality of desk or even writing on paper. It's just not a nice finish, kind of makes if feel gritty/dirty.  I might get a desk mat.Just expected better finishes for the price, given my past experiences.",3,2022-04-11,United States

R1VLWSQHBCI1P,"I work from a home office and needed a new chair as my old one was creaking, but I was hesitant as it was still comfortable and well padded. I chose this item because a number of reviews mentioned how comfortable it was over long periods, however I don't agree with this. I'm of average build, 6ft tall, and have no issues with the seat adjustment and height. The problem is the seat padding is not as lush as the product description would lead you to believe - you can definitely feel the base of the chair through the seat cushion, and after a relatively short while, it's uncomfortable.The other, minor complaint is that when fixing the base mechanism, the holes are too small for the supplied washers and it's impossible to fix as the install guide suggests. Leaving them out doesn't seem to be an issue, so it's a minor point.Overall, I will be looking to change it for something more suitable and wouldn't consider it again for an office chair.",3,2025-03-18,United Kingdom

I follow written instructions better than pictures so that was a problem.  Assembling was fairly easy but charging the batteries, knowing when they were fully charges and getting the machine to work all proved challenging for me!  Finally I resorted to some useful (American) You Tube videos and took off.  The lawnmower then worked fine.  I would suggest that Greenworks have some similar videos on their website for dummies like me to refer to (clicking the big green button to see the charge, clicking the battery into place all helpful)The battery charger lead was loose and the battery charger was replaced, sadly with the one model!  However the new lead worked well on the original charger so I suppose I was lucky.  The lawn mower does not like tufty bits so run over those on a high number first.  It doesn't like bumpy lawns.  I had to cut the whole lawn on 3 first before I could lower the blade to 2 for a short cut. Lowering the blade is a bit tricky.

Takes ages and patchy uneven cut - even gardener who comes when we’re away refuses to use it! I think I’m going to have to buy something else. Really regret this purchase.",2,2023-10-09,United Kingdom
R1YZF2ALM918NN,"Been using those for about a month. While well presented, the speakers blend well writhing a small minipc/monitor/stand environment. The main issue with them is that they are noisy and hum all the time, no matter where they are plugged (either on the computer, the monitor or on a remote USB hub). Trying the same connections with a pair of headphone does not show any issues so the problem is with the speakers. Based on that, I would not recommend the product.",1,2020-06-06,Canada

But what about  maneuverability?….well the hose is medium length but you won’t even be able to get around to the other side of your car to clean it without constantly having to lug the whole unit as it only has two wheels on it. Cleaning power?….average at best, it will get surface dirt off stone and wood but won’t deep clean and get the stubborn dirt off…..I used to think karcher was a great brand but after trying it myself I can see they’re just good at marketing and try selling you a lot of accessories that should be standard for the price tag.

R22LX6N6X3MVT4,"The desk has some significant design issues. Since the desktop is split into two pieces that you need to assemble, it doesn’t line up perfectly. You can clearly see that one side is slightly crooked, and the two parts don’t sit flush together. It just doesn’t look right.Now, if you’re like me and decided to ignore the reviews, and you encounter the issue where the desk won’t move up or down, here’s how I fixed it: 1. Unplug the desk from the power outlet and wait about 10 to 20 seconds. 2. Plug it back in. 3. Hold the up (^) and down (v) buttons simultaneously for about 5 to 10 seconds. The desk should move slightly up and down on its own, which means it’s resetting. 4. After the reset, press the up button (^) to raise the desk fully. 5. Then press the down button (v) to lower it completely.After that, it worked fine for me, but here’s the thing—there are a few more issues. First, mine came missing a crucial piece. The steel connectors that hold the two parts of the desktop together? You’re supposed to get three, but I only got two. So I ended up using one on each side, but there’s no connector in the middle, which probably adds to the alignment issue.You’ll also want to have a magnetic star screwdriver on hand. Most of the screws are set deep into the pieces, and without a magnetic tool, the screws keep falling inside and it’s frustrating to get them out. All they provide in the box is an Allen key, which doesn’t help for most of the screws.Lastly, the assembly instructions could definitely be improved. At one point, you’re asked to screw something in, then later, you’re asked to unscrew and screw it again—it feels unnecessary and poorly thought out.In summary, the desk works after a bit of troubleshooting, but I wouldn’t recommend it due to the poor design and missing parts.",3,2024-10-25,United Kingdom

R23JW9F1XBE0J4,"These GP Ultra AAA batteries aren't cheap because the manufacturers are feeling generous.  They're not cheap because Santa has come early either.  They're not even cheap because you've probably never heard of them before.No.  They're cheap because they don't last long.  We have used them in battery powered internal Christmas lights.  However, we're also running an identical set of lights off another brand of AAA batteries.  The GP Ultra had gone within 48 hours.  The other brand (begins with E and has lots of Energy!) is still powering the lights 3 days later.  So you're getting 40% of the performance of a major brand at a price that isn't 40% less.  That's based on the major brand lights dying today too - which they don't show any signs of doing.  I suspect the 40% is going to be more like 20%.I'm afraid I'll not be purchasing them again.  I'll buy a pack of other batteries from a major brand, undoubtedly with fewer batteries in it, that'll last a hell of a lot longer.If you still go ahead and buy them, don't come onto Amazon and say ""I should have known"".

R2413L6RWJ2NXF,"The assembly was fairly straightforward but could use improvement. Probably quite difficult if you were to assemble by yourself. There were 2 screws you need to undo to take apart a couple pieces that were screwed together for shipping. This part was not in the setup instructions so I was confused for a bit on how to move forward.Overall it's a pretty sturdy desk, looks nice and has enough room for 3 monitor and a small laptop.I have a few gripes about this though that are a bit of a dealbreaker:1. The motor or axles squeak when the table goes up and down. I don't think it's something that goes away from ""breaking in"" either. It just sounds like it needs lubrication or something (I'm not an engineer so I can't say for sure).2. I wish it was faster. It takes about 30 seconds to go lowest to highest setting. moving it up and down is also a bit finicky. Pressing and holding the button will move it slightly, and then stop for about a second, and then start moving again. If you let go, it will keep moving. So there is no option to just hold the raise/lower buttons and then let go when you're ready.3. The frame is very close to the edge of the desk. This causes a couple problems: A) My monitor arm's clamp doesn't sit flush to the table because the table frame blocks it from going further. Not too big an issue since the monitor arm still feels quite stable. B) Keyboard trays barely clear the frame.

R24GWQ8QA33YC6,"I've had two previous Karcher that have broken, the first stopped working and the second's motor disintegrated on its third use, unfortunately, it was out of warranty, typical. the reason I brought this Karcher K2 was it was cheap, the problem with this model is it has a different connection method, the hose is thinner and of cheap plastic, after I brought it I found my extension hose could not be used because on the new type of connector, I think the reason for the new connector was that the old screw on the connector would sometimes come off if now screwed on tightly and there was a problem with the plastic threads which easily broke off leaving no way to use it.  If Karcher had supplied an extra adaptor this model would have been okay but alas they didn't.So if you have the older versions' extra attachments or extension hoses or add-ons they won't fit this model.",2,2022-08-24,United Kingdom
R24IT86UJOWQB,"Do not fall in trap for this table. You can get excited looking at the description of the table which says Wood Top but its not - Its a chipboard top (the worst one).

I placed another order for Bamboo one where the description says the height is 50' but its not- the max height for that table is 48' and its not a EC5 , its E4 which is cheaper than E5. I had to talk to 10-15 associates from Flexispot - where each one of them gave me different options with false promises. At last I received a table frame and no table top at all. I spent 900$ (which will be returned) but wasted 7-10 days (30-40 min every day) talking to Amazon as well as Flexispot associates and they still couldn't help. I requested to escalate my case and get call from management from Flexispot and I am still waiting for that call and the table top.",3,2022-07-19,United States

R251JHD28WT636,"Decent quality picture for the price. Overall not bad.The big issue I found with it is the channel management, particularly the satellite channels, DVB-S. I was able to tune them all in, but only after having to add several transponders manually. This I could live with, but once tuned, I then found it was very tedious to sort the channels, took about an hour.Again I can live with this but then I found it doesn't keep the order I set. After watching for a while, when I went to change channels the order had changed. I tried resorting them again but the order was changing randomly even as I was trying to sort them. I then found it will randomly reorder the channels every time its turned on. Sometimes the order changes while your watching, go to change channels and they are in a different order. This is very frustrating when you have 150 channels. Funnily there is no such issue with the DVB-T channels, which have kept the order I set.If you are looking for a TV with a satellite tuner, choose a different one.",2,2024-08-03,United Kingdom

R256SJ2ZSV5WEU,"Arrived today and just tested it,It's not bad to put together but the instructions are poor ""not hard to follow"" but generally poor in their presentation,Operation is very good to get it running but once I put it onto the grass it's performance was exceptionally poor, the grass is not contained underneath and it spits it out up to 6ft in the air ""I am 5ft,6inch"" and I was higher than me. As it doesn't contain the grass it chuck it all over my decking and pond so now it's a massive clean up operation after using it.It's quite loud for a small machine as well, I was very disappointed in the cutting width,to me it's too small another inch would be much more useful.The basket doesn't really collect much grass for my liking and changing the blade is not a safe operation as you need to grasp the bit that spins around to get the spanner on the bolt to unlock it, but if your hand slipped you will slice your hand open.Overall I am dissatisfied and disappointed with this product and will probably be sending it back as it's not what I was expecting in performance or safety.The only good thing I can really say is that it's lightweight.Otherwise it's poor value for money.",1,2024-08-12,United Kingdom

It’s coarse to the touch, and while it’s fine when sitting with clothes on, my bare elbows or hands on the armrests feel itchy and almost like a burning sensation. On top of that, the mesh attracts debris and hair, making it hard to keep the chair looking clean.Headrest Issue: If you have a shorter torso, don’t bother with the headrest.

R295WQ182SZTZK,"Photographs included in this review.I have two of these machines. The newest one gave a reading so high that I had stage 1 hypertension, and the older one (when rebatteried and fired up to check the slightly worrying first machine) gave normal to low blood pressure readings. Readings were taken 5 minutes apart and then checked 2 hours later. In, any one of these machines could give a totally random result. As an aside, the one with the higher readings pinches so tight it feels like your hand is going to pop off your arm. Seems like it measures its own pressure, not the wearer's arm",3,2022-01-04,United Kingdom

R29K9SP9DKDOOX,"For £4.99 at the time of purchase this charger provides quality and value 100x over, in my opinion. The weaved cable is robust enough to endure day to day life and use without bending or flexing the internal wires fully being durable and neat at the same time, at 2m it’s the perfect length to have anywhere and comes with a handy cable tie if you want to reduce the length / prevent it becoming a trip hazard in certain environments.The only downside I have is two sided, I find the green led a nice touch however in my mind I thought the light was a charge level indicator at 0% no light then gradually going up in bars as the battery chargers with 100% being fully green. This is not the case however it’s just a solid light, that’s no problem though in my mind the design was slightly different. Be warned if your easily disturbed by light I wouldn’t have this in your bedroom as it’ll keep your room well illuminated for a small light! Could see how this could be a soothing touch for someone who finds comfort in soft ambient lighting, could always double as a nightlight.With a 3 year warranty you’ve got all the protection you need, mega value for money 100% recommend will definitely purchase more.UPDATE - after using for a couple of weeks my phone has displayed the message use a supported charger henceforth this being unusable!

R29LNKU51XAD5F,"Only set up this machine a few days ago - not expecting any probs given the bulk of the reviews I read.  (Also, it is not my 1st home BP monitor, if the 1st Cazon - plus, I am a retired RN.)  Surprised to read here it is a Large Cuff! monitor - NOT part of the description I read prior to order - & that explains one of the problems.  I am of average height/weigh less than 9&1/2 st - it's much too long, as well as stiff/unwieldy, cuts into my armpit.  Too-big cuffs tend to give a lower reading - this one pumps up to over 300! before giving me a result which suggests my BP must be blowing my brains out.  On each occasion.  Naturally, worrying.  However, today have used it on a friend - same scenario.  & when comparing both our BPs with the other monitor - which I found out how to recalibrate recently - huge discrepancy.  So this is a dangerous product in my view.  One to avoid.  Just unfortunate that the Returns date lapsed 3 days ago, which suggests no chance of getting my money back.

Therefore if you want to use your lance from an older model it is not compatible.  You also have to use a screwdriver to remove the lance connector. The spray of water is also too wide making it difficult to clean marks on block paving. The previous model worked better and the handle did not keep falling off.

Not to mention the tuner seems to be difficult to make find stations.Gaming on all my consoles that I have tried on it (PS3, PS4, PS5, Wii U, Switch, Xbox One X & Raspberry Pi) all seem absolutely fine with response time, although haven't seen a gaming mode that some might want.The brightness seems fine for the room I am using it in with good viewing angles.

R2BB1WCS172P2V,"Had an older, equivalent version for around 10 years, so when that one died, had no hesitation buying a newer version - oh what a mistake.I’ll start with a couple of relatively lowkey disappointments:1 - there were no clips to wind your power cord up around when you’ve finished, which were present on the older version.2 - the collection bucket felt cheap, and instead of sliding nicely into the slot (like the older version), you have to wiggle & jiggle everytime. Annoying.Worst of all, and I’ve only used it once, the hole that the grass passes through to get into the bucket seems about 20% smaller than the older version. So whilst the bucket is possibly a little larger, the grass struggled to make it in, and instead falls out as I moved round the garden. Everytime I lifted the lid to see how it was going, there was none in the bucket, it all just accumulated at the entrance.How this passed Flymo’s product testing I have no idea - Flymo have let the standards really slide.",1,2022-10-15,United Kingdom

I purchased a new battery (very hefty price) but also notice that the mower does not seem as strong as it used to be.  2nd - It now struggles on lower grade cuts - so I end up now having to set the level to 4 (used to have it at 2) - which means I will have to cut the lawn more often.original reviewI replaced my petrol lawn mower after 20 years (of hard use).  This mower is very well thought out as it folds down easy and I love that 1 lever adjusts all 4 wheels at the same time.  I have a normal size garden and get around 2 mows for each battery charge.  I would recommend getting this one as it comes with a 2nd battery for roughly £15 more.  To buy a battery separately runs around £80The good - easy start and fold away nicelythe not so good - build quality, I do not get the feeling that this mower will last for more than a few years as the body and wheels are made made of plastic and do not feel like they will stand up to hard usage - I hope I am proved wrong!!",2,2018-08-22,United Kingdom

But readings (when they finally came) were consistent so for such short term usage he stuck with it.After using a different monitor recently we found this Aile one was giving readings significantly out, 20mmHg high, which has impacted treatment/medication decisions.This device has certainly not been overworked, and it's been handled and stored with care.

R2D7SENKZA6LRK,"Always write reviews 12 months after the fact, when you've had time to learn what carnage you bought.  Take my review as gospel.This chair started off well enough, well enough to have folk rush to write a 5 star review... but after a few months the squeaking shows its face, every time you sit down or get up.... squeeeaaakkkkk.  It's the nastiest cheapest sounding squeak you could imagine.  It's horrific, and if in a meeting or call it permeates any kind of noise reduction.And the chair leans slightly to one side when you're sat down on it.  I tried to understand why but couldn't shoehorn a fix, and other people have reported the leaning too so it's something to do with the design or manufacture.  It's not good for your hip posture.And finally, the mouse-wheel fluff they used for padding is dreadful.  It falls apart within the fabric after a few weeks so it feels like you're sitting on a moveable paper mache.STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS.",1,2024-12-22,United Kingdom

R2DNE0EIFXC1ZR,Rubbish to be blunt.  It is like a hoover and only takes a small layer of grass off my large garden.  Compacts the grass well in the bucket but you spend over an hour going over and over it to cut it. Very disappointed.  I already had a big size flymo and I thought this may work just as well but it is more like a light trim.  A neighbour has the same one and he said it is rubbish.  May suit a very narrow small square of grass but not usual average size.  I noticed as I spent a good hour mowing twice my electric bill increased by an extra 20kw,1,2024-01-14,United Kingdom

The cushion is thin so after an hour of sitting you can feel the frame through it, which gets uncomfortable. But nothing a pillow can’t fix. It’s also quite low compared to a standard office chair even on the highest setting.

R2HQVNJC7RMWXC,"The absence of wires is great - so quick to get it out and working - when it wants to work that is; mine has a mind of its own about whether it will start and often needs the battery to be taken out and put back in again to get going.  But the worst element is the lack of power.  It cannot push the cuttings through the gap and into the (small) grass box.  It just dumps cuttings all over the lawn.  I have to go around two or three times to 'hoover' up.  So what I gained in not moving the wires, I lose by having to empty the grass box 5 times more often than I did with my wired Bosch.  I doubt it can deal with anything more than moderate length grass.  It just doesn't have the necessary 'oomph'.

This was fine until a couple of weeks ago, when a) at one point it just froze on the home screen and nothing would react. Had to unplug and reconnect. Then b) randomly on returning from an app the screen will display only in the top left quarter, i.e. as if the TV was half the size in each dimension. Nothing will persuade it to change other than again unplugging and reconnecting.

R2IHW9P3MR3U84,I purchased this desk to replace my work desk due to the standing features.  The base was easy enough to assemble but the problem came with the wood top.  I followed instruction per the guide and the wood would break off around the screw holes when screwing them in.  The second adjustable top was the worst.  All the support assemble broke around the screws and made it impossible to make it sturdy.  I should now use the lift bracket as it would not secure anymore to the base.

R2LBIQDTHT2IYC,"The impact detection ""feature"" of this desk is a complete joke. When the desk ""thinks"" it hit something, part of its routine is to stop, and go in the opposite direction for like an inch or two. If it thinks it hit something on its way UP, it stops moving up and moves back down a little bit.... Well what happens, is on its way down, I didn't realize my chair was in its way, and it proceeded to run into the chair. Fine, I think, no big deal. As it keeps traveling down, my instinct was to press the UP button to make it go back up. It goes up for about a few centimeters and then decides that, on its way up, it hit something (it didn't). What happens is that even though I've pressed the up arrow, it sucks itself back down even further. Each time I pressed the arrow key to go UP, it went up just a smidge, and then back down even further than it already was. It snapped the Flexispot keyboard tray completely off its bracket because I literally couldn't make it go back up, it kept sucking itself down on to my chair. Who knows what would have happened if someone was sitting in the char while this was happening...The issue is twofold. The desk simply cannot sense changes in pressure as an impact. My chair, like most office chairs, is on a gas powered lift, so as the desk was moving down, the chair was giving a little bit. Even on its highest impact detection setting (most sensitive) it could not detect this. The desk is also overly sensitive to phantom impacts as well. So on its most sensitive setting, it takes me 5 minutes to get it to raise because it keeps thinking it hit something when literally nothing is in the way, and I'm not even touching the desk.I've resorted to turning impact detection completely off, because at least if it DOES hit something, I can control it, vs it just doing whatever it wants to do.",1,2024-07-13,United States

R2M9YDAJFJRTDB,"It does the job and I won’t send it back...but I wouldn’t recommend it either because of several design flaws.1. As others have said, the cutting head is heavy. Not too bad when trimming vertically, but the more you diverge from the vertical the heavier it gets. Very difficult to manipulate horizontally unless you have strong arms. Bought this to replace my old Ryobi 2-stroke hedge trimmer which became heavy when extended by two sections, but this is heavier!2. Trigger is placed badly – you have to reach out behind you to find it. Worse still, sliding trigger lock has only a slightly raised edge to operate – impossible even to feel it with gloves on.3. Connecting sections way too fiddly. Internal sockets are a bizarre shape and will only connect one way. Outer surface of sections badly in need of a slot/tongue, or alignment arrows, to avoid having to peer inside the section to see if sockets are aligned.4. Heavy cutting edge needs some sort of handle. Its smooth outline makes it very difficult to hold when connecting to a section because there’s nothing to hold on to.5. Cutting edge can’t be adjusted to full 90 degrees like my old Ryobi hedge trimmer. Can’t think of a good reason why not.",2,2024-07-25,United Kingdom

R2MJ97DK62YA2U,I was shocked that this brand is a badly designed product with no housing / cradle to carry the cleaning solution bottle instead there is a crude pull out tube to be put into a bottle on the floor which does not seem to work properly and limits any movement of the unit. The build is cheaply constructed in thin plastic with a flimsy pull up handle also flimsy. All in all I found this washer very poorly constructed with flimsy switch and plastic fittings it would have been easy to add a cradle for the cleaning solution but this is purposely made to make you buy additional parts to properly utilise the cleaning solution. All in all it's a cheaply made housing the pressure rating is no better or worse than most pressure washers that are much cheaper. The single positive is the rotary tool so all in all I cannot recommend this poorly designed tool.,1,2022-05-03,United Kingdom

Best ones I have found are the Scentsy which are rather expensive but you can find cheaper at about the same price as this Air Wick. With the Electric Scentsy and similar cheaper Diffusers you can choose your own aroma from essential oils and water as many times as you like and run for as many hours as your oil lasts rather than the limited hours in the Air Wick Oil bottle which seems sealed and cannot be topped up.",1,2018-04-25,United Kingdom

I had seen a youtube video saying this is identical to Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, except slightly less sillage and less longevity.This scent, which is meant to smell like the Tom Ford fragrance, falls very short of the real thing. It lacks the same depth, complexity, boldness. I find this to be weak and disappointing in comparison, but it is wearable. My husband has even sprayed it on himself.

If you do a have ago, you need  to be armed with up-date passwords for your Wi-fi router and Amazon account if you have one. You also need to have a TV with at least 1 HDMI input socket and a spare mains supply for the gadget. You will also need passwords etc. for streaming services such as Netflix.

Technically it works well and saves you the cost of a new smart telly, but I have personal reservations about the endless sunami of films and TV programmes, mosly American, that streaming floods into your UK home.

The last replacement has lasted exactly 6 weeks and then you guessed it, alternating E2 and E5 and it tricks you, it inflates and then stops and you think ah, I'll get a reading displayed in a moment but nope it'll start inflating some more and strangle your arm before tripping out and displaying either E2 or E5 and don't bother contacting omron, all they tell you to do is a reset or send it to them to 'look' at but you have to pay for the sending to them and provide a paid method for them to return it back to you after. Really not great when you have to check your bp and heart rate every day in order to take heart rate and bp controlling medication that can drop both dangerously low if not carefully monitored.

Unless I was sat right by them.Literally wasted my money.Will never waste a penny on anything like this again. I messaged air wick themselves and they basically blamed me. even though it's the product itself that's rubbish.How I can be sat in one room with 5 or 6 of these and still not be able to smell them is insane. The puff literally just goes a little bit up and falls right down. Doesn't spread anywhere even with a window open.If it was just one... It wouldn't be a problem. I'd just get another, but it was all 5 or 6 of them that did the same thing. It's obviously a manufacturing issue.

R2SKWBRL5920M3,"I purchased the CAZON Pressure Monitor with high hopes for its accuracy and durability, but sadly, my experience has been nothing short of disappointing. After just two months of use, the device has completely broken down, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied with its quality.From the outset, the monitor seemed promising. It boasted advanced features and a sleek design that appealed to me. However, its performance failed to match its outward appearance. Despite following the manufacturer's instructions meticulously, the monitor started exhibiting erratic readings within a few weeks of use. Initially, I attributed this to minor glitches, but soon enough, the device stopped functioning altogether.What's most concerning is the lack of durability exhibited by this product. I expected a pressure monitor to withstand regular use for an extended period, but it fell short of even the most basic expectations. The sudden breakdown not only renders the device useless but also raises questions about its overall construction and reliability.Moreover, the inconvenience caused by the monitor's failure is considerable. Monitoring blood pressure is crucial for many individuals, including myself, and relying on a faulty device adds unnecessary stress and uncertainty to an already important health routine.Given my experience, I cannot in good conscience recommend the CAZON Pressure Monitor to others. Its poor quality and short lifespan make it an unreliable investment, and prospective buyers would be wise to consider alternative options from more reputable brands. Disappointment aside, I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for those considering purchasing this product.",1,2024-03-19,United Kingdom

R2UEVTVAEYOY75,"The chair was easy to assemble and is comfortable for the most part. The adjustable headrest and lumbar support is appreciated and does a good job relieving lower back strain. It rolls smoothly and is great as a first desk chair. However, I've had this chair for around 4 months, and I'm neither impressed or unimpressed. It's a mostly comfortable chair with its problems.Firstly, the seat is uncomfortable for me. I have to place a pillow on it and if I'm sat upright, I still feel uncomfortable after a while. When the backrest is locked in place it still moves around a lot, with a preference to want to fall on the left or right side - never directly back. It gives the feeling like there's a pole behind you and the chair can only move backwards either side of it.Lastly, it's started squeaking a lot and it's unbearable. I need to source a good lubricant and hope that I can identify where the sound is originating from, which is inconvenient and disappointing, because the chair was a lot better at first.I've seen a lot of reviews praising this chair which is what encouraged me to make a purchase as well, but I wish I had bought a different one.

This makes them impossible to stand on a shelf and makes them much more difficult to store!! The green surround is a thin piece of cardboard which falls off as soon as the plastic wrapping is removed! It’s not a container even if it looks like it!I bought these because I’d used them before and really wanted the advertised storage container which you can stack on top of other batteries in a cupboard.

R2WQDX9J3MLU5Y,"Worst piece of kit I've ever bought for prunning hedging, and apple tree branches.  The battery life is poor, and takes ages to recharge. The trimmer keeps cutting out within 20 seconds of use even when it's battery has been charged continuously for 24 hrs.  It then needs a rest before it will start again. Very frustrating. The trimming end is too heavy. I just wonder if the weight of the trimming end is breaking the connection with the power supply hence the cutting out? The belt provided to help support the trimmer is strong enough to do the job however once in the branches of my apple trees  it gets tangled in branches and had to be removed when in use. I suspect a handle part way down the trimmer would have been more use to me. The distance between cutting blades could have been wider as the width precludes large brances from being cut. I believe the trimmer is underpowered, or under torqued. I've got an old Black & Decker trimmer 36V which makes mince meat of the Ryobi. It's like comparing a Ford Fiesta to a Formula 1 racer. Unfortunately the B&D trimmer doesn't have an extendable arm. The shame for me is that I bought it in July and didn't use it until now, meaning the window to return it has now closed. My advice look elsewhere for a similar product, ot try the Ryobi out as soon as you buy it in order that it can be returned if it doesn't do what you want..",1,2021-09-19,United Kingdom

R2X0FUE6VN13BQ,"I bought this to monitor my BP throughout pregnancy but quickly noticed that the readings fluctuate wildly - first reading came up at 160/92 then straight after at 103/84. I rushed to the hospital and my BP came up relatively normal whilst the monitor still showed that I was close to having a stroke! Cuff is also very small and the metal catch that doubles it over to close often makes the cuff slide to one side so when inflating it really hurts - especially when it decides to inflate above 200 before reading.I have tried monitoring left and then right arm but get the same skewed readings that vary greatly so I don't bother to use anymore.Wouldn't recommend for measuring BP but screen is good, as is the ability to use mains power or batteries.Definitely would not purchase again or recommend to others.",2,2023-12-03,United Kingdom

R2XUZLP74GPF41,"So going to cover the good points first since the table part of the table is pretty good:Table part is solid once assembled which is far more difficult than it needs to be but more on that later, the specific one I went for was the 100x60 black frame/rustic brown top model. The finish on the table part is great and the whole thing is very stable.Unfortunately apart from the fact that the standing aspect of the desk sort of functions that would be the end of the good points.Next I would like to give a warning to anyone looking to purchase this product, firstly add about 6cm either side of the desk for the hooks that come with the desk. In my case I had a very small amount of space to work with and had measured the size needed with very little leeway. I was concerned when I received the item that with the hooks attached I may not have the space clearance needed but decided to proceed anyway trusting that the anti-collision technology advertised in the listing would save me from any potential issues, this was my mistake.The anti-collision claims are complete rubbish, upon raising the height of the desk one of the hooks mentioned previously got caught, the anti-collision aspect was nowhere to be found and there is now a chunk missing from the bottom of the desk after the hook was ripped off the bottom of the desk.Again I only proceeded to try and make the whole thing fit with the hooks due to this advertised feature, since it didn't work and the desk is now damaged I have no idea where i stand on the warranty but since in one of the documentations provided it states that any damage caused during the use of the device is not covered I imagine any such claims would be declined.This is not the end of my issues with the electrical features of this device either, according to the instruction manual I should be able to set the minimum and maximum height the desk can change to, neither of these options work. In fact when pressing the settings button according to the instructions i should be able to switch between S- & S+ both of which do slightly different things such as setting height limits, however no matter if you hold press this button or anything else this cannot be changed and is generally pointless.Luckily the memory buttons do work so it does not impact things too much but still this is not great as if I am reading things correctly in the event of an error the desk will return to the minimum set height, which in my case would damage the desk. So lets hope I don't have any more issues although i'm not going to hold my breath.So far I have covered issues with the device itself. Next would be assembly and company practices.So firstly this company is complete scum, waited specifically for the prime day sale in the hopes of getting a good deal, this desk was the only one i could find within the size limits i needed which was on sale so i decided to go for it. This sale however was a complete lie, I purchased the desk for around £150-£160 but was charged £40-£50 in postage i believe, a few days after the sale had ended I checked the listing again to make sure it had the anti-collision tech advertised due to the previous issue and found that the table was now £200 ish with a £10 postage charge so realistically there was no discount.The box the desk came in was heavily damaged and if this experience has taught me anything in the future any purchases costing more than £50 I will be recording the unboxing from start to finish, opening the box I found all the parts included but some parts specifically of the frame were pre-assembled, chalked this up to it maybe being an out of date instruction set so continued on but as I went on found more and more indications that the frame of the desk at least was second hand. Such as pre assembled parts, dirt/gunk in some of the parts and some admittedly light scratches to the frame.Decided to continue using with putting things together as I could clean the frame and dont need to look at the damage plus figured company likely wouldn't believe me that I had not been the cause without said video. Again lesson learned.Next came assembling the top half of the desk, as others have pointed out the desk comes split into 2 halves along the length, now that it is assembled this is not an issue but the assembly process was awful. Specifically the screws used to secure the 2 sides together were self tapping and they only provide a tiny screwdriver to assemble. I tried as hard as I could to use what they had provided but in the end had to borrow better and larger tools from the inlaws to finish assembly.This is the first time I have ever actually bothered to leave a review on an amazon purchase and personally feel the review is perfectly justified. All I can say is if you intend to buy this item, record your assembly and usage from start to finish.I hope I will never be forced to use this company again as it definitely will not be by choice.",2,2022-08-07,United Kingdom

R2Y1F62VK2LH3C,"The worst problem is the boot for the side that has the controller does not fit, it has a different number than the other side, and the other side not having the wiring harness in the way works fine. Why is it needed, well, without that boot the motor will flip Up/Down in the same direction as the movement, maybe that is fine... but not OK in my book. I was able to get it about a quarter of the way on and had a same size but much longer bolt (Where you see the bolt, that is supposed to be flush with the back, and you shouldn't see a bolt). It seems to hold, but this alone is reason to avoid this product. The second crime of this, is the instructions are pointless, nearly no words just pictures with incomplete ones at that. Such as before putting the top on you have to remove the middle bolts -- but please don't mention such trivial challenges for the customer. The seam is held together by 3 metal bars held there with 2 small wood screws each. While I am sure there are experts out there who can flip a tabletop without flexing it -- it is horrible design to require superhuman powers. (Hats off to the exceptional people who manage that). Bonus round -- the short side did not line up, so it took careful stepping the bolts down from going in on an angle to slowly work them systematically to get it to secure. Pretty sure this misalignment design is what causes a squeak noise at the lowest settings. Bonus round #2, the wood screws are long enough to poke through the table, just held back enough when using the framing (ok so far as that is doing what it is supposed to do) but they do not have any such framing for the cable management that you want to put in there for the wire that connects the two motors. While I had enough experience to know that it isn't necessary to put those in all the way, there are no warnings to the user and seems (like much of this) as if there was exceptionally lazy engineering. It will do the job, and after spending the money, not tossing it in the trash. However, I cannot recommend anyone else go through this experience. Very disappointed.",1,2024-04-08,United States

R2YNTIHXMKIK9Y,"Had this chair for a month now. The design looks nice and it certainly look great and easy to put together. However you get what you pay for, the material is on the cheap side, and the chair doesn't ""line up"" perfectly - you can see and feel it is mildly lobsided. There is definitely something out of line on weight distribution most probably caused by this lob-sidedness. The padding of the seat is relatively thin and cannot retain it's shape very well, adding a seat cushion is an option but the problem with weight distribution out beat the little comfort an extra cushion adds.Conclusion is that it is not comfortable enough to sit for too long. It is my office chair so I have to frequently stand up before ache sets in on my bum. The back of the chair is ok though.

R2ZJSUXP4TEYGT,Chair arrived and I was able to assemble it without a problem but as soon as I sat on it I could feel it was tilting slightly to one side. Just enough that after a couple of hours working it was causing pain in my back. I had sit with a folded towel on one side of the seat. As well as the tilt it made loud cracking sounds if I moved slightly in any direction.I contacted the seller and they needed me to send a video of it making the noise and pictures of the tilt.They then offered to send me a replacement base plate and said they would send instructions as to how to remove the original one. Base plate arrived but no instructions.So YouTube videos watched..I wouldn't have had the strength to remove it from the gas cylinder by myself but did manage to with help.Chair now not leaning and therefore is at least functioning as an office chair. Still making occasional cracking noises so I don't hold out a lot of hope as to how long it will last.And still not entirely sure how happy I am with having to fix my own brand new office chair!Certainly wouldn't buy this one in the future,1,2024-07-17,United Kingdom

The hype on YouTube made me blind buy this and I wish I could send it back for a refund or at the least a credit for the price but since it’s considered to be a “FLAMMABLE PRODUCT” you can’t return it.

R2ZY6N86ZGFY7G,"The components - except for the defective part they were shipped with - appear to be good quality and as advertised. That said, if I had received the correct parts to assemble it upon arrival, I would have given it a much higher rating. Now giving it 1 star for 2 reasons: 1) Unacceptable QC/QA: Only after spending 1/2 a day attempting to scrape off the excess paint on the Part #3 connector to modify it to fit with Parts #4 & #5 - the left and right support beams - per the instructions - was it revealed that in an attempt to match the color of the rest of the black desk components, the Connector Part #3 I received had been modified with an extra layer of black over the original brown paint to match the rest of the black desk hardware in the kit. The result was that the extra thickness caused by the extra coat of black paint over the original brown paint made it impossible to insert Connector Part #3 into Parts #4 & #5 - the left and right support beams - per the instructions - even WITH the screws removed - also per the instructions. The end result was that the inclusion of a modified part in this shipment rendered Part #3 nonfunctional and made what SHOULD have been straightforward fast and easy assembly process a complete waste of 1/2 day trying to modify it to fit before learning after contacting Customer Support that they would replace the defective part. 2) After Customer Support asked for an address and phone no. & said ""it"" - which upon further questioning they finally confirmed meant ""the frame""- would not arrive for 5-7 days, if shipping does take the full 7 days, since I will be out of state on business the week it arrives, this will further delay my ability to assemble and use the desk. If the manufacturer could not ship the desk with the correct Part #3, instead of modifying a Part #3 designed for a desk kit with brown hardware by painting another layer of black paint over Part #3 thereby rendering it nonfunctional just to be able to ship it sooner rather than later, the better use of everyone's time would have been for the co. to notify me that they would ship the desk as soon as the correct part #3 became available for the kit I ordered.",3,2025-04-19,United States

R31L0CVTDKO3PW,"The desk is fairly sturdy when constructed.  The drilled holes on the bottom of the desktop are not aligned with the frame, but you are able to drive the screws at an angle and get them in without drilling your own holes.  I was able to do everything by hand without a power drill.The problem with the desk is the material.  When I first opened the desk, it smelled awful.  It was a very sweet smell, kind of like syrup - I have not experienced this before, but solvents often have a ""sweet"" odor.  I live in an apartment so I aired the desktop out on a friend's balcony for over a week, and had it in a ventilated area for weeks after that.I've finally assembled the desk as the sweet smell is not perceptible any longer, but I am having congestion and eye itching while sitting near this desk.  I have to assume the particleboard is off-gassing formaldehyde or other components of the glue used.  The electronic components/plastic on the controller also have a very strong odor that remains perceptible from a normal sitting distance.Products will usually off gas for a decade or more, and that is why I avoid terrible composite materials.  However, it is impossible to find a standing desk this small in natural wood, as far as I could find.  I guess if you are too poor to afford a large house, you might as well have respiratory discomfort and eye itching?It would be nice if this company or some other would offer a wooden desktop option in this size.  I may try and build one myself, though if one were made available I would definitely upgrade.  Particleboard is a terrible material, particularly if you live in a small apartment with no forced air ventilation.  At this point I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep this desk, but I hope I can cope with the issue.",2,2023-05-18,United States

R33XIIGI5HNB7C,"This may be somewhat of a niche issue, but there will be ppl out there pulling the hair out when trying to get the Audio Return Channel (ARC) working via a home theatre setup with something like the Echo Studio.In summary, if you have this Fire TV stick and an Echo Studio, you can (in theory) configure a home theatre setup for your audio. Effectively, the Stick passes audio through to the Echo device.You need a TV that supports ARC, but there appears to be an issue with disconnects, no audio and general bugginess of the stick.  Every time they provide an update for the stick it seems to breaks the home cinema setup and you will end up rebooting, restarting and resetting the stick and there's a 50/50 chance that it may fix the issues. I persisted for 5 months, but it finally reached a point of being pointless, so I returned it as faulty for my needs. I now just use Bluetooth to connect the Studio to my TV which is okay, but not refined.So, if you want the Fire TV stick for anything other than an ARC setup, go for it. But if you wanted to use ARC this will not be the reliable solution.

R33ZQCWFTMRCAC,This product i waited to buy for a while.yes it's sturdy but the design flaw is the weight is furthest from where you hold the switch....I lift weights and even I found its design awkward...yes it cuts but you'll need practice.....conifers are no problem. I was doing a siberian privet hedge and it was doable but be prepared to sweat heavily.one more thing the strap is to low down...the top hook could be further up to steady things.All in ...yes these pole trimmers are better than ladders but they ain't magic bullets either.,3,2022-07-16,United Kingdom
R344H41O3WL131,"The designers didn't think hard enough. Instead of placing the motor close to the battery and transferring the drive via a spinning rod through the handle, they opted to put the motor next to the blade. This means that all the weight of the device - and it is much heaver than my mains powered strimmer - is at the business end. You'll have to be a strong man to wield this for more than a few minutes - especially if you use the extension handle.. If you're 70+ years old, like me - forget it.

R345WP467CL1IZ,"I bought this to replace an old kitchen TV. The picture quality is fine, but the sound is dire - annoyingly tinny. Worse than my first transistor radio, bought in the 60's! Luckily, my partner had a small computer speaker which he was able to plug into the headphone jack and the sound is much improved. Otherwise I'd be sending the TV back. The TV guide is sub par and confusing. Instead of displaying several channels with the programmes that are currently on, the EPG shows eight channels, but only displays programmes for a single highlighted channel. So you have to go through each channel individually, which is a bit of a pain when there are over one hundred channels. But it's only a kitchen TV and not used half as much as the one in the living room.",3,2023-01-10,United Kingdom

Credit to them for this, but I've made the purchase and I don't want them to be out of pocket. And to be honest I've dumped my old one so I'd have nothing to sit on.To clarify. This is NOT a bad chair. The last chair I bought was three times the price of this one. As such it was definitely better quality. Was it three times better than this one? I don't know.

There were absolutely no indications on either the desk or the instructions themselves that suggested assembly be done in a particular way. I am a career engineer, and in my former life I was a building contractor, so I know how to use tools and assemble things. The problem became immediately apparent when I went to use the desk. I contacted the company to advise them of the issue, they were very responsive, but their remedy was to offer me $20.

R38AJVBPO2SOAL,"I bought this to replace and ageing Sharp 22 inch TV in the kitchen, i thought i would upgrade the size too, as we watch it while preparing food and while seated in the mornings.The good:Easy to set up, good range of inputs, the connectors are easy to get to as they are on the bottom on the rear, i needed a right angle antenna lead as the leads will show otherwise, it is a full HD. The Vesa mount was useful and fitted fine. Sound level is OK for our kitchen and was at 50% for a 8 metre distance. It supports HD Tv but has problems. Remote is easy to use, and has a sleep timer function, it also will auto power off after an adjustable ECO time. The brightness is fine.The bad:The picture has a lot of motion artefacts (even when all processing turned off). The picture on HD channels blank out briefly at random intervals. I have a 92% signal and 100% quality on the affected channels using the info display, so this should not happen. The worst problem with this the VA display,  the viewing angle is appalling. The selling page should really list the panel type for people in the know to make an informed decision,. It is OK straight on, sit slightly to the left or right or down a little and it is awful.I have given it 3 starts for looks, features and sound. Picture is important. This lets the otherwise good Tv down. I will be returning it.

However , if you do you probably won’t even get to notice the scent for any sustained period of time . If you have the diffuser on its highest setting then you will get more bursts of the pleasant scent  , just don’t expect the refill to last much over a week .

R3A18G67OIVGJT,"This is a device firmly at the budget end of the Karcher range and it shows. The plastic moulded case is not robust and will not stand any form of rough treatment. It is easy to assemble and operation is really simple. I found it useful for cleaning stone, masonery and brick, but useless at anything else.Like all power washers there's always a problem with the complexity of leads in and out of the machine. It needs a power cord and a water source input and both of these have to be manoeuvred around with the device when in use. It's a pain. The pressure washing wand comes with a self knotting hose which will get on your nerves. No matter how you unravel the hose it will self tangle and get in the way.

R3A517X68U9YLK,"Finally I found a TV that has all the connections I need (especially an AV one 4 my PS2). Too bad it only has ×3 HDMIs, I expected 4, but it has come as advertised. Of course the connectors are all at the back (which is a bit of a shame), so of course I payed for Amazon's TV Engineers to install it. In which they came on: Tue 4th June (06.) 2024. @12:30pm-1:00pm. Now the brightness is way too bright-you'll need to change it in the settings. Which are complex. As you can see there is not just a brightness button but a whole range of settings for it. I wish it was simpler & had just a brightness button. Appearance looks fine, but it is small & thin-which I personally dislike, since: it makes it harder to hold & more fragile.  So I bought the same TV but bigger (50 "") and gave this old one to HH (Hope Housing) on: Thur 25th July (07.) 2024. Because I highly doubt Amazon would refund me especially right now. I mean it has been past 30 days. Performance is fantastic-haven't had a an issue with this as far as I'm aware. Luckily I've had that TV enginner install it for me; since the instalation process looked hard-I mean for flip sakes you have to register for this with Roku, which is stupid. During it I believe there was a card check also-just to check if you're an adult. This being even more dumb/ridicolous. Delivery is fast though. Literally ordered it on: Fri 31st May (05.) 2024. And got it the next day: Sat 1st June (06.) 2024. The signal & channels are great though and has all you need. Despite the negatives, however, it is a great product, once you get through the 1st/these hurdles. :) :)",3,2024-07-30,United Kingdom

R3B27TB7W35L2M,"I'm giving the desk 3 stars, leaning 3.5, because functionally it is fine. It is sturdy, looks nice, motors operate well; as a desk it is fine.That being said, there are some really inexcusable issues for the price point that FlexiSpot is at that don't even exist on no-name brand bottom of the barrel for price I've built in the past.For reference, this is the third standing desk I've built off Amazon. One for me when COVID hit that was truly a ""don't know if this will work"" cheap purchase, one for my wife, and now this one.I bought the bamboo kit with the desk top included after going back and forth over getting a butcher's block and sanding/staining it in my apartment. After agonizing over it for a while I went with the combo from FlexiSpot. The top and the stand ship from two different locations at two different speeds, but you only get one tracking number. This meant that the base was out for delivery so I disassembled my current desk, it showed up, but no top. There is a note on the box that says it will ship separately.It took three extra days to arrive, so I jumped ahead a bit and had to plan my week around a desktop showing up at no known date.Second issue as many others have mentioned, the screw holes on the desk only partially match (just the outer support holes). There is no holes (not misaligned, they just don't exist) for the center support screws. The holes for the motor panel don't even align with this model for 2/3rds of them, they just don't exist.With that said you'll want a screwdriver handy and potentially a small bit drill to get starter holes because the self tapping screws aren't very good at biting.I'd expect this on a barely $100 desk, but at $600 it is kind of ridiculous that they're clearly just reusing stock and not bothering to update it to match the kit they're shipping now. In fact, the old desk I was upgrading from (size was too small and sturdiness was an issue) did have all the correct hole patterns, so it seems kind of insane that at 6x the price and a ""name brand"" in the space these don't even have an attempt at 6 of the holes you need to screw in.I was able to put it together by myself, just putting a warning out there for others that may have more of an issue with that.3.5/5, it's fine, as a desk it seems like it will work well, but such simple things are poorly managed from an industry leader here.",1,2024-06-28,United States

I only discovered this the first time taking one out, so the next time had to hold the mop head over a sink just to put the wipe on it. Awkward and fiddly. They are also tricky to fully attach to the mop head and it takes a lot of struggle to make them secure. A couple of times whist mopping they came away from the mop head.After finishing the floor and allowing time to dry, the floor was left with streak and wipe marks through it that were very visible.

I even pushed the monitor right up against the wall to prevent it, but as you can see in the video, it's not only dangerous, but very cheaply made. Also, I made sure that all four legs are perfectly flat on my floor so it doesn't rock because of that. The desk rocks back and forth because the arms that extend go way to high for its depth and that causes too high of a point of gravity for the desk to be stable.

R3CUBCIDS3JIY8,"For me (and probably for most people) the most important element of a television is the picture quality.Being technically gifted, and having a very keen eye for detail, it falls upon me to set up the four televisions in our house.  Three of the four, are an old, inexpensive 32 inch Bush HD television, in one room, and (we had) two inexpensive, 32 inch JMB HD televisions in two other rooms.  I’m mentioning these tv’s because although they were cheap, they were literally plug-in and play.  There was no need to adjust the picture settings whatsoever. They produce deep black, crisp white, and the perfect amount of brightness , contrast, and the colour, so that the picture quality was like anything else in the real world.  It was like looking out of a window which (in my humble opinion), is how an HD or UHD television should be set.The picture quality of our cheap HD tv’s is the level of quality I’d expect from much more expensive televisions, but these were cheap and old (as in when HD first became available).I said all that, to say this: By contrast, this RCA tv is definitely not a plug-in and play tv, unless you don’t care if the picture actually looks natural.  I can accept that there may be some picture setting adjustments required, but when someone like myself find it impossible to achieve even a reasonable picture from it; then, that’s not good.  The kicker is, my wife who is not technical, and has absolutely no idea how to set up a television, could tell that the picture quality was exceptionally bad.  She’d been accustomed to watching the old Bush tv which I thought we’d replace with the new RCA, and put the Bush tv in a guest bedroom where the JMB tv had finally given up the ghost after many years of outstanding service.I was reluctant to put a brand new tv in the guest room because it’s not used enough to warrant it, so I went through all the trouble of hanging the RCA in the master bedroom.  That was a mistake.  After all the trouble of hanging it, I could not (with all my technical skill) get a picture quality that even my wife (who is not technical) could appreciate.  So, with great exasperation, the RCA tv was removed from the wall, placed back in the box and returned to Amazon with piqued expediency.If picture quality is unimportant to you; then, this or any cheap television will do the job, but if it is; then, I’d say don’t bother purchasing this tv.I would’ve given this review one star, but the tv comes with its own mounting screws (which a new tv rarely does), so there’s that.",2,2024-12-17,United Kingdom

This does not take much force and does not seem to affect anything, but I know they are bent.The assembly instructions leave a lot to be desired. When assembling the top, it doesn't specifically mention to do it upside down, then flip the supports down to screw them in. I may have damaged the pegs holding the top together lifting it because I didn't understand this from the instructions. There are other unclear factors in the instructions, that's just the largest one.The ""socket"" wrench supplied is a huge pain. Much easier just to use your own 10 mm deep socket on a 1/4"" drive.The screws for the bracket which supports the power supply are too long and caused the top to dimple where they pushed up from below.There is no way to route the cabling to the control panel without going under the crossbar.

R3E7O3DXWXOPV7,"The build quality is SO CHEAP - the desk itself is some prefabbed MDF board that has a bunch of unused screw holes(probably because this is a cheap board milled for many different purposes/vendors) and bends with the lightest amount of force.The legs attached to the base are attached with tiny wood screws that have so much play if you move the table lateral.The headers barely sit right when plugged into the controller.The worst of it all - I spent an hour putting this together, and the motor DOESN'T EVEN WORK. I couldn't even get past the ""Reset"" stage. There's so much bend on the tension rod cuz there's no supporting mechanism that the motor just gives up. (See image - it's always red no matter how many times I reset)I went with this because it was cheap - but I should've listened to my wife, she had a Flexispot and that one is SO MUCH BETTER.

R3EC93JUPS9GNG,I bought this because the display on my old machine had faded in places and made the numbers difficult to read. This monitor looks like a decent machine when it's pulled out of the box. The cuff is a good size and it's good that it can be used with both batteries and USB. However!!! I took my first reading and it was 160/128!!!!! Heart rate 70...Is that even possible!! I took it again 122/86 HR 80. Other readings have been as high as 158/116 HR 65 . Another reading 116/76 HR 77 which is the kind of reading that my old machine gave. How are we meant to know what our actual blood pressure is with such random readings like this?! It's enough to make us either ill or obsessed with checking it.At other times the cuff has inflated so much that I had to rip it off because it felt like my arm was going to explode.I wish I hadn't thrown the packaging away because I really regret paying for a machine that is causing me more stress than peace of mind.,1,2023-09-16,United Kingdom

R3FKHQC7AF3XLQ,"Coming from someone who uses several professional hedge cutters for work purposes, this is rather tricky to use and overall a mixed bag. However, considering the price it's pretty decent for home use (which is what I purchased it for), but here are some things I think are worth knowing:- I arrogantly ignored the other reviews about weight before purchasing, thinking the comments were coming from those who don't use hedge cutters often, but no this thing is rather heavy. The issue is that it's top heavy with the trigger controls at the far opposite end. Imagine you have a long pole with a tiny grip and a lump of metal at the far end, that's what its like to try and wield this. It's especially bad when you use the extension pole to extend it over 2 metres.- The harness doesn't really do much to support the weight and I ended up taking it off at times- Considering the price, you get an alright bit of kit here which is decently well made in terms of the quality and performance. It cuts fine, has a nice sweeper attachment which helps remove cuttings if you're doing the top of a hedge. I used a 5.0Ah battery for about 45 minutes and only lost one bar of charge. The noise levels are low at 95dB but still wore ear protection as it's over 85. Would also recommend a face shield or some kind of goggles at the very least, I had a piece of hedge shoot towards my eye the first time I used it and luckily I had a shield on but I could see the mark it left...- Two issues I have with the design is that the trigger and grip are at the very bottom of the device and the adjustable angles aren't great for cutting the sides of a hedge. I'm used to holding the grip further up as it gives you far more control and makes the weight distribution a lot better. The grip and trigger can also be uncomfortable to use on the hands, you have to awkwardly slide the safety switch up and then grip the trigger rather tightly as there's a lot of resistance in the trigger itself. This is especially difficult when tilting the device on its side to cut along the side of a hedge. I get that its a safety feature so that it doesn't turn on easily but yeah, it wares the user out quickly and cramps up your hand. The adjustable head works well for the tops of hedges, but typically when you're cutting the side you want to angle it slightly away from the hedge so that you never accidentally point inwards and gouge chunks out - this isn't possible with the Ryobi as the only adjustable point for pointing away from the hedge is almost a 45 degree angle which is too much.- The reach is very good, I did most of the garden without the extension, and then the tops of some tall hedges with the extension. It gives a lot of reach but it's very hard to control at that height and considerably more heavy as you're putting the heaviest part even further away from where you're holding onto.My review may put people off but for the price I'd say it isn't an awful piece of equipment. For me it came down to the fact that I already had their charger and battery, so it made sense to get this instead of another brand. After the first 20 minutes I got the hang of the weight and how to control it, and after that it felt a bit better to use. It's great for casual use, and I'd even think about using it if starting out self-employed, but for longer use periods, bigger projects, or well established self-employed gardeners this isn't an obvious choice. You'd need to pay 4-8 times the amount for excellent kit, so that's worth weighing up.",3,2025-03-01,United Kingdom

R3GN8QOR4UGXO0,"UPDATE:I'm knocking down my review a bit now that I've had this desk for a while. Unfortunately, the lowest setting (28.7"") on this desk is just way too high unless you're (according to desk height calculators) 5'9.5 or taller.I am 5'4 (average height of US women) and I have to sit on top of pillows (since my chair is already adjusted to maximum height) in order to keep my elbows above the desk, but because of this, my feet dangle causing me to have to sit cross-legged on my chair which is not ergonomic at all. If you spend a decent chunk of time sitting when you're working at the computer, this will really catch up to you after a few months.I find this to be a major design flaw since globally 60% of men and 99% of women are under 5'10. I really love this desk otherwise, so if you are in that 20% of the population 5'10 and over then jump on this, but if you're in the other 80% of the population, I'd recommend looking for something different.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I’m loving this desk! I knew that the seam on the split top desks (that aren’t even that much cheaper) would drive me wild, so I was very happy to see that Flexispot sells whole piece desks. I wish I stood at it more….. but the adjustability is perfect for both myself and my partner to sit at comfortably.  The 48” size is perfect. Sometimes I wish that I had gotten the 55” so that I had room for a second monitor without things feeling off centered, but the 48” is great for making sure I keep my space clean :) For reference my laptop is a 17.3”, so quite a bit larger than a standard laptop.Shipping was fast, I love the bamboo finish, and it was super fast to throw together. The included cord tray and hooks are a great touch. I definitely didn’t need the height memory as much as I thought I would, but I dig the usb and usb-c chargers and get a surprising amount of use from them. I run the adjustments on this quite often to push in my chair at night (the arms catch the cross beam otherwise) and haven’t encountered any issues.I definitely would buy this again if I needed a desk!",2,2023-04-26,United States

R3IETJ7I8FK823,"They are small, cheap speakers. They sound like really good small cheap speakers. Bass is non existent below 100hz, and there is a hollow resonance around 125hz. They sound a lot better once that is EQ'd out. Mids are actually clean, surprisingly, but the highs are very distorted, almost piercing. They don't sound like they have as much of a V shaped eq as I expected, which is surprising. They're definitely not flat, but the eq isn't too bad. My biggest problem with them is the distorted highs. Anything above about 6khz just sounds really bad, and my ears start feeling fatigued after about an hour of listening.These will work very well for podcasts or YouTube videos, but for music I would recommend something else. Creative's Soundblaster speaker line is a good alternative, or the Klipch Promedia is an excellent set of speakers and can often be found on sale for a great deal.",1,2022-09-05,United States

They are very easy to put together but I do not recommend buying these, for them to break so quickly. They have lasted only a few months and we have had to buy new ones.

In many ways the FireTV stick is better, but it fails in one key area: BBC iPlayer is currently unreliable on it. You can't add the BBC channels to the live TV EPG (which would transform its usability) and the iPlayer itself often just fails to load and goes to a black screen (clear the cache, uninstall, reinstall, OK for a few uses, then repeat).

Also, it seemed smooth, when it worked. See the con's for more details on this.The so-so's: the actual work surfaces are thinner than expected, and they weren't completely predrilled for assembly.  But I made it work.The con's: well, the unit stopped working after one day.  And I get it, sometimes things like this happen. But...1) I tried the troubleshooting tips in the manual. They didn't work.2) So I tried calling the toll free number listed in the manual, and on the customer service card that was included in the box. No one picked up.  After waiting for a number of minutes listening to the phone ring, a pre-recorded message told me no one was available and to call back later. So I did.3) I tried calling at different times on different days.  No one ever picked up.4) So I emailed customer service, telling them the unit stopped working and none of the troubleshooting tips helped.  What did they do? Emailed me a list of troubleshooting tips try. And - get this - if they didn't work, I was to send them a video of me trying the troubleshooting so they could then figure out what's wrong.5) after a few back and forth emails, and providing a video, the best suggestion I get from them is to ""hold the down button for a few seconds and hopefully it'll work."" It didn't.6) I'm still waiting for a response by email.  And they're still not picking up the phone.So my advice to you is: if you buy this unit and it works for you, you'll probably be happy.  Just hope you never have to contact customer service.UPDATE 2/2/22: I finally got a response from the Flexispot customer service, and they're replacing the control panel, plus the one leg that has the motor on it.  HOWEVER, that was 10 days ago, and I still don't have my parts.  Or a working desk, for that matter.  To make things worse, they couldn't provide a tracking number. Seriously, can this get much worse?  I'll update this review if I ever get my parts.UPDATE 2/7/22: today (5 days later) I was told by the Flexispot customer service that they would not be sending me the replacement parts and want me to ship the defective unit back to them.  Keep in mind that the desk is built and the box was recycled long ago.  I'm not sure how this is going to work out.  I'll keep you posted.UPDATE 2/8/22: today, the Flexispot customer service told me the replacement parts have been shipped but they can't provide me a tracking number.  SMH.  Back to the beginning.....  again.UPDATE: 3/20/22:  Flexispot finally sent me a new unit.  I replaced all the electrical components and got the desk working in 5 minutes.  Hopefully it keeps working.  This is my last post.",1,2022-01-19,United States

Pay a few quid more you can buy a quality Honda 18"" electric lawn mower.But for me (A female) I like it, yes it's really expensive for what it is. Only problem(s) I have is sliding the battery into the lawn mower (which fits up-side down) compared to the charging unit, which is also of poor quality.On a positive note: It cuts the grass, but don't let it get to long and make sure you buy a 40volt version, not a 24volt.My partners advice is: If you prefer quality lawn mowers, avoid this rubbish and look for a better quality lawn mower.",2,2022-06-25,United Kingdom

I have to empty it constantly, the hover is mostly non existent, I find myself forcing it along the ground so it flattens grass and doen't cut it.  The few times it does actually hover and ""glide"" I find myself thinking ""huh this is almost as good as having wheels"" not quite but almost.

They are NOT designed for super high-quality sound. They are designed to give you GOOD sound.I tried them for a couple of months but I felt there was not enough bass in some cases, and in other cases I felt like they were not providing the full spectrum of the music I was listening to. For example, I listen to vinyl records using the PC speakers and my previous speakers were SAMSON studio monitors. They were GREAT for music, but they were too big and I had to sell them. I thought these little speakers would suffice, but they did great for regular PC stuff, but when music hits....they fall short.If you are not an audiophile, then yes, you can bet they will sound good enough!",3,2024-06-07,United States

R3QKQHWT5HOZET,"I've had a similar mat before that I had been using for years without any problems until i lost that one so decided to buy this one which looked similar. First, my old mat didn't have the anti slip. This is ok as it is stated and i simply didn't realise so my fault. However I recommend buying one that slips i.e. does not have anti slip as every time you move in your chair or change your body position you will invariably change your wrist position and so will need to adjust the mouse mat. Not a problem with the item, just personal preference.My problem with this item is it's very strong smell. It is a very chemical smell, plastics fresh from the factory? I don't know. But when I received the mat (swift delivery btw!:) the smell was so bad that within 3 minutes of using it I got a headache and my entire room smelt. So I hung the mat on the laundry line in the garden. First for a day then had a sniff, still bad. a week later, still bad. about 2 weeks of airing in the garden I finally took it in and am using it now. While my room does not smell of the item anymore, my hands/wrists do after using it for a few minutes. So when you click with your mouse and then move your hand near your face, the smell is everpresent!

R3QT4Z38M02APH,"Firstly, the good news; the smell reported in earlier reviews isn't there. It's pretty much odourless.But here are the negatives;(1) the working surface of the pad is too small. I have a high resolution vertical mouse, which occupies slightly less space than a standard mouse mouse, and I still have to lift off to get to the extremes of the screen. If it was a plain rectangle or 30mm bigger in both directions it would probably be ok.(2) the gel wrist support is very hard and sits right under where I had my carpal tunnel release (5 years ago, so no residual pain). The result is that the wrist support digs into the now unprotected median nerve and causes both finger numbness (remember that?) and pain around the wrist area. This is by no means an ergonomic solution, and I can't believe it would help somebody who hasn't had surgery for this condition either.In summary, I suspect that following complaints about the smell, the manufacturer has changed the formulation of the gel making it a much harder material. This is going to cause you a world of pain if you have a carpal tunnel issues. Landfill.",2,2022-05-23,United Kingdom

I does keep things cheaper, but it would solve the next problem.I found the cables aren't that long and connect oddly to the right speaker, not the left as is customary. soI ended up with the left speaker on the right and vice versa. A built in sound card could have provided a solution, as would a hardware switch, but again, cheap is the game.

R3S1AJ8SP2XTHR,Sadly I've had to return this lawnmower as the batteries lose their power over time. I was impressed when I first got it and was able to use it for the last cut of the season. It mowed both my front and back lawn on just one battery. I put it away for the winter and have now completed three cuts. One battery no longer cuts the two lawns anymore and struggles to cut one.  Initially I put this down to the longer grass from the winter (I had to charge both batteries twice to mow both lawns)  but even now I'm mowing weekly it is still taking more than two fully charged batteries to cut the lawns. I'm having to wait for the first battery to charge enough to finish them off.  This is not the first cordless mower I've had. The other needed a new battery in the end so it makes them a particularly expensive piece of kit as the batteries aren't cheap. They therefore cannot claim to be environmentally friendly as disposing of the batteries are harmful. They just don't last.,2,2024-05-27,United Kingdom

R3U7HVL9229DBS,"I've used this mower for my small lawn for about 6 months now, it does exactly what you would expect from a Flymo hover mower and does so at a great price. The mower is very light and easy to manoeuvre, the blades are decent and cut effectively, even longer grass. The assembley process was easy and the instructions are were clear.I do have two issues, the grass box is very small, my lawn is about 5mx5m and I have to empty it about 4 times per cut. Its not a massive issue as the as its so light that taking the amount to the garden waste bin becomes quite tiresome when you are trying to cut the grass quickly!The second issue is build quality, I have used Flymo mowers, for more that 25 years and never really had any issues, this one however has very poor build quality. The plastic is very thin and if not correctly placed could buckle or break in the assembly. The other issue with build quality relates to the plastic hinge/retaining bolt that holds the handle to the mower, this broke after only two mows, and I have replaced it with a metal bolt I had lying around.Overall, ok for the price but build quality lets it down.",3,2023-12-19,United Kingdom

R3UNB4FIEU07W3,"As with a lot of cheaper priced audio equipment, the volume knob clearly ruined any speaker reliability. Arrived in perfect condition, plugged in easily and then the windows volume test sound through the right speaker sounded like I awoke a demon.Looking back again now, other reviews seem to indicate that if they didn't arrive this way, it was just a matter of time till that static turned up (and almost always in the speaker containing the stupid volume control knob). Turning the volume control affected the level of static; turning it directly to the middle (or facing straight down) had the best effect at removing the fault but all sound disappeared from the faulty speaker along with it!Maybe I got unlucky but every speaker seemed to have a number of bad reviews and the design for these looked slick (and still look pretty nice in person too).

R3V9WMQQ5NPMQG,"Some people have said they thought this was light. As in 'not heavy'. That's false. It might be light compared to a petrol hedge trimmer atop a pole, but that does not in of itself make it 'light'. Just a 15 minute trim of a beech hedge and your forearms will tell you to quit.But is there a better option? Perhaps a pole saw.The problem is both the weight distribution (as mentioned elsewhere) and the fact you're dragging a hedge trimmer across a hedge, not just the blades themselves. This makes it extremely unweildy and downright tiresome when it catches and sticks every six inches of travel.As for the cut, well it is marginally better than normal trimmers but the reality is that you simply cannot get decent leverage from far below the intended cut. It's a huge struggle for cutting back thick growth and you need to be very strong to weild it.",3,2023-03-19,United Kingdom

R4BYG3QEG4JWG,"This is just a basic issue with sit-stand desks. They wobble front to back and side to side, especially when I’m raised position. That said, this desk does more front-to-back wobble than others and so much so that I can’t even write notes while on Zoom or the desk shake causes my web cam to shake as well when cam is sitting on my monitor.I found a site that tested wobble on desks and explained the design elements (think cross brace for one) needed to reduce the motion. This desk is actually lacking all of those elements. The materials are heavy-gage, but unfortunately the wobble motion renders it unusable for video conferencing, gaming or work like Photoshop where your mouse or stylus will be moving a lot and will this cause this desk the wobble front-to-back and shake your monitor.Testing website was btod dot com and desks that rate well on motion are unfortunately twice as expensive as this one or more, unless you can find the #2 ranked IKEA desk in stock.I like the look of this desk, but the motion is just not tolerable.

Secondly I could not get the handles to move or the locking pins to stay in place so I can only mow with the handles set at a bad angle. As I cannot move them forward the mower is difficult to store and also because of this it makes it difficult to turn corners and I now mow the lawn in a circle!

R6BRXEGI7P2KB,"This desk doesn't work. Let's put aside the wobbly floppy horrible build of it. Seriously, I'm typing this review with my monitor and it is just wobbling and shaking like crazy - it gives me a headache, ugh.But here's the issue. This thing just doesn't work! I've wanted a standing desk forever, and was so excited to use this. I got it all put together, went ""Ugh"" at the shaky build quality, and decided to give it a shot anyway.Well, first issue: The UP button moves the desk down, and the DOWN button moves the desk up. But even worse, the rest function (which the manual says is supposed to move the desk all the way down) instead moves the desk all the way up, and then I get a red light come on the keypad, and the whole desk is just frozen.Unplugging and plugging it back in SOMETIMES resets it, but then after a few UPs and DOWNs, red light again, dead keypad.No way to reach out the seller in the packaging material or instruction manual, which is dubious at best, and alarming at worst.I will update this review if a resolution comes, but for now, I'm beyond disappointed.Even a FAQ/Troubleshooting - what to do if a red light comes on, what to do if the buttons are reversed, where to email for help/questions… but I got none of that.My advice is to stay away from this cheap, fly-by-night manufacturer. Sad to say, and I so wanted to love this desk. Man…",2,2024-10-16,United States
R6G2CSO2EDYE5,"Started off great, was impressed with how easy it is to navigate around the home screen using an equally simple and impressive remote control. Links well with Netflix and other channels. 2 months in however, many TV series are unwatchable on Amazon Prime because the screen keeps going black even though the sound is playing. Some series it works for and it also works for movies. Tried all the usual resetting tips for getting rid of the black screen, but it keeps coming back. Shame really",2,2025-04-03,United Kingdom
R6GAKBRIS8XZL,Been looking for something similar to Tom Ford tobacco vanille for less. This smells good however I would not call it an eau de parfum. Eau de parfum is towards to stronger side of the scent spectrum and usually lasts 4 to 5 hours. This is extremely light scented and I would say it is towards the lighter end of the scent spectrum like an eau de fraiche. Need a few sprays and lasts about 2 hours or less. But then that's why this is around $30 and Tom Ford is around $400 + for the same size.,2,2024-11-15,United States

I tried logging in though my phone - it sent an alert but didn't recognise I'd clicked ok.  I tried a password (even resetting) but it just hung.  I tried a one time code - nothing.  I followed advice online - turn off and on, delete and reinstall the app, clear the cache, etc - nothing.I even received an email from Disney+ to tell me a new device had logged into my account, so no issue from their end - the stick itself just wouldn't play.After an hour I gave up and asked for a refund.",2,2024-11-04,United Kingdom

We built it following all the instructions and it was fine at first but soon after I started having issues with the height sinking for no reason. We took it apart re built it and it's no better. I start my work day comfortable and end up on the floor. The back support is also terrible if I lean back I feel it's going to snap or tip.

It turns out that the (accurate) blood pressure machine supplied by my doctor reads my systolic pressure as at least 20 points lower than this machine does every time.So this machine gave me readings so high that it's going to cost me a couple of months of testing and messing around before I can get on with my life again.

R9YQ5WB5G8HTM,"I bought this TV for my 80 year old parents, specifically because it is “dumb” ie no annoying smart features or online activation just to watch terrestrial tv.The price, picture and sound quality is amazing compared to the 15 year old Sony Bravia it replaced (that ironically was struggling to retune and was losing channels), but the user interface is worse than I thought it would be (my expectations were low for a very cost effective unit) auto tuning litters the channels in what seems to be a random order and it is challenging and time consuming to move eg bbc 1 to “1” that every other tv I have used does automatically.I actually think a smart tv might have been less stressful to set up.",3,2025-01-10,United Kingdom
R9YZ3YGAN5ERH,"I’m a big fan of Ryobi equipment, having a drill, circular saw and multi tool. The cordless system is great, so I bought this with confidence. It is however much heavier than I expected and the harness/shoulder strap is essential, but could be improved in some way, to help the balance. It works well an don’t regret the purchase but found it cumbersome, so be warned, it’s certainly not lightweight.",3,2022-03-23,United Kingdom

RA3TXMIKY074U,"This is the worst lawn mover ever, it doesn't hover , its really  hard to push forward , it works well backwards which isn't how its meant to be used, first time I have had a Flymo and definitely the last I will stick to Boshe as far better and easier to use , tried with different blade levels and makes no difference, waste of money as will have to buy a new one to replace this before having a back injury .",1,2024-08-19,United Kingdom
RA4ENVP66D8N9,"I’ll say this: for the price, it’s good value. Comfy enough, looks decent – a nice addition to my home office. But here’s the rub (and believe me, you’ll hear the rub): it’s a bit... squeaky. Not ""mildly amusing sitcom-level squeaky,"" but full-on “Are we filming a low-budget horror movie?” squeaky.Sit still, and you’re golden. Move even slightly – adjust your posture, lean back, or God forbid, swivel – and it’s like the chair’s auditioning to be in a percussion band. The 90° flip-up armrests are nice, but I reckon they’re just there to distract you from the symphony of squeaks the rest of the chair produces.In summary: a bargain if you plan to sit motionless, but if you like to fidget or recline, you’ll find yourself questioning life choices. Or at least chair choices.3 stars – functional, but it’s not exactly a quiet achiever.",3,2025-01-10,United Kingdom

RAEC7IZMOJJ4Q,"Basically, it comes and it does not take to much time to put it together.  That's where you can see its made very cheaply.  On the first mow of the lawn I detached the box to empty the grass and the handle fell off. Grass everywhere, looked at pushing it back in and could see that the plastic is so thin and cheap that it had already worn away - after one use.  I would not recommend this product.",1,2021-11-27,United Kingdom
RAEJFS45O6DJ,"Bought this TV for my mum who doesn’t need a smart tv, so that’s fine. It was delivered on time and a tv engineer tried to set it up but couldn’t get the channels in the correct order and then they kept going off again as he was tuning it. The screws weren’t packaged in any sort of order and were just loose. We sent that one back and another one was delivered efficiently. The same tv engineer installed it for my mum and it worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then she lost all picture and sound and got a message saying ‘please wait’. The engineer came and fixed it and said it was a fault with the tv and not user error. Gave it the stars cos delivery was efficient and the picture is good - when it works! Certainly wouldn’t recommend, though.",3,2023-05-18,United Kingdom

RAKILYE7EEX3Q,"I'm currently using these speakers as my ""desktop speakers"" because I just haven't bought another set yet. But I'm not crazy about them. Cons: While the sound is pretty clear and doesn't sound cheap, the volume has a strange way about it, and there's no bass or treble control buttons. The turn on/volume knob that you turn takes a long way to turn before hearing the volume, therefore leaving you with less ability to turn it up louder. So because of this I had to install a sound & volume program on my computer to boost the volume up to use with these speakers. The physical design of them looks cool to the eye, but I find it difficult to place them somewhere that's not awkward. Pro's: They have a bit of weight to them, which tells me they aren't cheaply put together. Their structure is definitely solid and the input cords and plug in cord are lengthy enough to be able to move them around different kinds of desks.",2,2023-10-15,United States

RAN25EQ7C4JIZ,I bought this item due to its claims of fast charging. I've tried it on two separate chargers and it managed 30% in an hour. It's only suitable to charge at normal speeds but its claims of fast charging are a bit over estimated. Looks and feels like a well built product but sadly fast charging it's not in its dna,1,2024-11-15,United Kingdom
RAQ80OFCN7TTE,"I'm sorry, I suppose I didn't read the product description carefully enough.  I had hoped that it would enable me to trim a high hedge without climbing steps.  Unfortunately, it's so heavy I can't control it.  The weight is all up in the air and the control trigger is almost behind my back.  So, if you are a heavily built tall person - like a neighbour who managed it for me -OK - but small, elderly, though reasonably fit like me NO.  I'll probably give it to the neighbour.",1,2022-09-26,United Kingdom
RARIU6DWHYU0R,"Rubbish, it doesn't hover very well and has to be pulled backwards and drags. It doesn't cut grass very well and has to be redone over and over again.

I took it inside to investigate and noticed when I got it to start it had flashing lights inside the body before it stopped again, I looked in the manual to find what this flashing meant and found no reference. I did it again and realised it was the motor inside sparking. Long story short it's dead on arrival. Now I have the trouble of disassembling and returning. What a waste of time and money.

RB1O15VXI2RMW,"I have the fire cube so bought the 4k stick as a gift after reading how similar they are. The reason I chose this as a gift was because the TV had become slow to navigate. Unfortunately the fire stick 4k is no better/ possibly worse.Set up was a joke. There were about 5 update screens and had to log in via QR code twice. Not only that but it gets you to download the fire TV app which you didn’t have to before. After 20 minutes of slow updates you have to fight past various screens trying to sell you Amazon services and download sponsored apps. If it were a free product this wouldn’t be so bad, but it was a gift which was quite embarrassing.I can’t recommend it. It’s slow. The power cord is too short. It’s also uses usb micro even though it’s not 2007.If your feeling nostalgic and want to experience janky mid 2000 like tech, this might be for you.",2,2024-04-26,United Kingdom

RB5AVF1VLQGZW,"Both the base and the tabletop are pretty solid and good quality, and the desk works well overall. The tabletop is actually about 59.5""x29.5"" instead of 60""x30"", but that's no biggie. My main gripe is with the assembly. The manual shows a tool that looks like a power screwdriver and casually mentions in tiny print that you need a drill. Guess what, DRILLING is required, too. Seriously?! I get that some people might enjoy marking 18 holes, choosing a 7/64"" bit, and making sure each hole is 10 mm deep, but that's not my jam. If I'd known about this fine print, I would've spent a few extra bucks on a tabletop with predrilled holes.",1,2025-02-26,United States
RB7THRY5SP0JN,"No matter what I do, I can't get the thing to 'hover'. It sits on the grass and has to be dragged/pushed across it like a dead weight. It might work on a bowling green, but anything slightly rougher is a task too far",3,2024-07-03,United Kingdom

Until I tried to download the Britbox App.  I have an older Firestick on another tv which can cope with Britbox as does my laptop and phone but after half an hour with online assistance Amazon finally admitted that it actually is unavailable on 4K version!!Plus the price dropped by £20 between my purchase and this conversation with Amazon.

Great for those who fit into that category, but for the rest of us...*crickets*I am trying to figure out which replacement cuff will work but there's no specs as to the diameter of the hole I need to fill and I don't want to buy something only to have it not work.

RDVXCMMGPF7HW,I bought this to replace a MacAlister pressure washer from B&Q that which started leaking on it's 5th use.  I was surprised to find the Karcher an even flimsier build quality.  I was already feeling sceptical that these materials would last more than a use or two whilst unpacking the parts  only to find the main body of the machine split open.  This is made of such flimsy materials it's unthinkable they can packacge it without protective materials.  Allegedly their more expensive models are made of stronger stuff but I'm deeply offended they would bother selling this junk I don't feel like rewarding them by purchasing their potentially worthwhile version.If I thought it was built well enough to work more than a few times I would have ordered a replacement but it's build quality is junk. Product refunded.Broken. Flimsy materials. Don't  trust it to last more than a few uses. Product refunded,1,2024-06-25,United Kingdom

RHBIQJN7472HP,"UPDATE : 22/3/22I regret having to downgrade the rating of this monitor from five to two stars.  Although it worked well during its life, its life was short, not quite nine months, before it stopped functioning. It would inflate, but not deflate, leaving my arm tingling and painful, displaying only a code Er 1 and occasionally Er 2. Nothing coaxed it back to working condition. Although its cost had been modest, its short working life meant that it worked out more expensive than my five year old Omron, which is still working.Durability and reliability are part of a product rating as well as performance.  This had been my travel monitor because of its compact size. Don't want to be travelling abroad without a working BP monitor. Back to Omron. Buy cheap, buy often, they say.---------------------I bought this in order to have a more portable BP monitor to take with me on journeys where space and weight are at a premium.It is simple to use, just put on the cuff in the right position, and push the start button. Given the low cost, I was surprised by the accuracy and repeatability of the readings, which I compared with my Omron MT10IT. They are the same to within +/- 3mmHg in both systolic (upper figure) and diastolic (lower figure) readings, which is no more than natural variability between readings.Unlike the Omron, there is no facility to transfer readings to a PC, but I knew that anyway, and up to 99 readings can be stored for each of the two user settings on the Aile monitor. The memory function shows the average of recent readings, and allows you to cycle through past readings, which are stored with date and time. One small caveat is that holding down the memory button will not cycle through past readings more quickly, which is what I'd expected - it clears all readings! You have to press for each reading, but that's not difficult either.Although it wasn't mentioned in the instruction leaflet, the monitor also can detect irregular pulse rhythms, which will, if present, be indicated by extra lines that appear around the 'heart' symbol on the display.There is no separate charger supplied, but there is a micro USB cable so the unit it easy to power, either via a USB cable and a power brick or 4 x AAA batteries. I've found this much preferable to dedicated power adapters. Unlike the reviewer who only got about 40 readings from a set of batteries, I have had approximately 180 readings from a set of four 900mAh rechargeables.",2,2021-10-24,United Kingdom

RJ451GPJPHM31,"I'm not tall at 5 foot 11 (or 181cm) but I have to stoop to use this thing. It would have been so easy to make this machine great, it cuts grass as you would expect, the battery last more than long enough to cut three medium lawns, then grass collector does it's job. So why 1 Star. The height adjuster does nothing practical, it just makes the, already long thing, longer. The overall length is too much for easily steering around my non-rectangular gardens. To get the thing to change direction (and get the strips in your lawn) I have to stoop down which is uncomfortable. I can only think that they never had anyone over my height every use the thing. A simple ratchet would have solved this. To store it in a compact manner you have to unscrew it at four points, not hard but completely unnecessary when simply quick release would have worked. The cut height adjuster is a flimsy piece of plastic that looks like it will break at any minute. It's not just my version either, I looked at others in their range and they are all the same. Simple put, they didn't try to make this user friendly. Such a shame.",1,2024-05-22,United Kingdom
RJ693XNYO9LUC,"For some design reason when you use this drill with a 10mm bit (the largest it can take) doing so will cause a malfunction in the chuck mechanism. This has happened on BOTH the drills I've had of the same model. Foolishly I though the 1st one was just a one-off. Nope, the same thing has happened with the 2nd. Unfortunately the 1st failed outside of any return period. This second one has lasted only a few months since buying it.I can't explain exactly what the problem is, just that it has to do with opening up the drill wide enough to take a 10mm diameter bit. Doing this evidently takes the mechanism past some 'ideal' operating range and causes the chuck first to 'lock' open, then when you try to hold the chuck and overide it (with some grippers or a vice) it results in the whole unit winding itself out of the end of the drill.Anyway, fine up to BUT NOT INCLUDING a 10mm diameter bit.

RKDGQICDK1EU0,"TLDR: If you get the 24”D version, the predrilled holes in the desk top will leave you with a 1.5”-2.5” gap between the desk top and a wall because the desk legs are deeper. So if you care about that, consider measuring & drilling your own holes.I got the 63”x24” desk. If I had room for a 28”D desk, or if I wasn’t putting this desk against a wall, I would probably be leaving a 5 star review. The issue with the 24”D desk is that the legs are about 27”D. So if you attach them to the top using the manufacturer’s pre-drilled holes (without measuring first, because obviously), you’re left with min. 1.5” gap between the desk top and a wall. Add an inch or so for baseboards, and you’ll be left with a 2.5” gap as shown in my photos.My boyfriend thinks it’s not a big deal, but I think it looks bad. Not bad enough to return - I think the desk is very good quality, and technically there’s an easy fix if you know the issue ahead of time - but I’m annoyed because now I have to take this whole thing apart, drill a bunch of new holes, and re-assemble if I want to fix the problem.FWIW the actual assembly was pretty easy and straightforward. Again, the quality of the desk is nice. I just wish the legs matched the desk OR the pre drilled holes accommodated the legs OR there was some kind of forewarning about this.Also, I did contact Flexispot to see if maybe got the wrong legs. They responded almost immediately asking for my invoice info, but then never actually answered the question.",3,2025-02-08,United States

RMEAK6IR8UHST,"I have been using 5.1 Creative speakers for my main PC for over 8 years now. They are still working, and give amazing audio. So obviously, when shopping for something to boost the audio quality of my laptop, I ran into Creative Pebbles, I was excited.Talk about disappointing.----------------------- AUDIO QUALITY -----------------------Well, it's.. alright. I mean, compared to the torture of listening to laptop speakers, these will sound amazing, for a day. Then you start noticing how bland their audio is.The audio isn't even neutral. There's a slightly more bass to the audio, which to be honest, is the problem with Creative's speakers no matter 5.1 or 2.0. They seem to love throwing in bass to compensate for audio quality. Basically, you'll need an equalizer to fine-tune the audio to not make it sound awful (again, way better compared to laptop speakers).----------------------- BUILD QUALITY -----------------------Though they feel sturdy at first, the same problem that plagues every Creative speaker, plagues this one.Thin wires that you'll end up accidentally pulling on.In-fact, the Pebbles are round, so I ended up with one rolling off the table and it hanging by the thin wire. These are not going to last long if you are going to use them frequently. Oh and ANOTHER problem that plagues Creative speakers show up here as well.Small wires.Yeah, they love their small wires. Enjoy that few centimeters distance that is awkward to place unless you have a flat table to place the speakers on. You can't use your laptop on, well, your lap, because the speakers are short wired and need to be placed next to the laptop (unless you want to buy extensions, which is just silly for a laptop speaker setup).Oh and there's a flimsy subwoofer attached on top, which you'll constantly end up touching and I bet, one day poking a hole into with your hand.----------------------So in the end, are these still worth buying?Not at the price I bought ( Rs. 2,599). These are worth Rs. 1000, maybe Rs.1500 max. Else just buy a cheap soundbar, unless you plan to watch movies/videos or games, which is why I bought these.",2,2024-11-09,India

RNQNTMED7WUX6,"Wanted a cost effective alternative to Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, this isn’t it unfortunately.The fragrance starts with a huge hit of alcohol as many cheap fragrances do, after his you get a nice shot of vanilla with a tobacco base but the vanilla quickly disappears to leave a strong, and in my opinion, not pleasant tobacco odour.This reminds me of a pipe tobacco pouch and not a sophisticated tobacco scent, but given this is a tenth of the price of TF TV perhaps that’s not surprising.Not recommended.

Buttons to set day and date feel very cheap as does the strap and not as heavy as I’d expect from a quality watch, so I’m not convinced it’s genuine.

ROW6EH8BE0XK9,"For the price, it's alright, which was £40 when bought. The seat is not very cushioned; you will feel the hard wood in the middle of the seat after some time, which gets uncomfortable due to its unevenness. The actual major issue I had with this chair is its rocking ability. In the first few days, it was good until it got very wobbly and always leaned to the left, needing to be moved all the way to the right to make it even again and remove the free lock. It also makes a lot of squeaking noises even when moving around the chair or leaning on one side a tiny bit, which gets very annoying. I am not sure if this is due to me having a faulty one or what, since I've seen nobody mention this. But other than that, everything else like the installation was straightforward and simple. For the price of £40 on sale, it was an okay-ish deal, but there could be better alternatives out there for the same price when they are on sale or spending a bit more for way better comfort.",3,2024-04-07,United Kingdom

RPJTUYHABNIL8,"My old Karcher power washer, which is over 25 years old, was a basic model but made of superior materials compared to this new one. The hose connecting to the lance is made of hard plastic that tends to stay coiled, and both ends that plug into the machine and lance are also plastic, which makes me doubt its durability.Initially, the lance trigger was sticky, but it seems to be improving over time; however, it's also made of hard plastic. don't think it will stand up to much abuse, The hose length between the washer and lance is 5 meters, but it frequently tangles with the power lead and water hose as you have to walk around the car (because of the coiling of the hose) this making it cumbersome to use. The pulling handle feels very flimsy; when I tried to drag the washer around the car along with the water hose and electric cable connected, that's why you have to lift it around the car.After washing one car, the power washer also got very hot when I started to wash the second car.I will keep this as it has a five-year warranty and buy a new longer rubber hose with brass ends that are on Amazon.",3,2025-01-16,United Kingdom

RPOHUC2MHFUW5,"This chair was perfect for what I needed it for at the time - my budget was limited and my previous chair was broken. For context, I'm not a serial chair-breaker, I am around 5'11"" and 90kg, and I'm usually sat on it around 4-7 hours a day.Assembly was easy and quite fun, I had no issues and the tools it came with worked fine. My initial thoughts were that the arm-rests' material was quite sharp; I typically sit in a t-shirt, so my elbows or forearms are directly against the rests, and the depth of the gripped material took some getting used to.I bought this chair about a year ago (January 2024, it is now January 2025) and the chair is noticably listing to the right side. I sit on it relatively straight, but over a year's use it has tilted further and further, to the point where it has a noticable 20 degree slope when empty. This is exacerbated when reclined, as it tilts towards the right. This is fine for me, who has spent a year getting used to it, but anybody else using my chair immediately gets thrown off-balance and complains.As it is holding its structure, but at a 20 degree angle, I determined that it was the internal metal structure that has warped over time. Now, I am by no means skinny, but I definitely did not think of myself as dense enough to bend an apparently indestructible and sturdy chair, so this review comes as a result of a slightly bruised ego.This chair will do you fine if you only have exactly as much money as it costs to buy it, but I am sure that if you shop around or buy a nicer one it will last longer than mine has. The sharp arm-rest issue may also not be a big deal for those in jumpers, hoodies, or with hairy arms; I will leave that up to you to decide.TL;DR: Chair started sharp and ended wonky",3,2025-01-20,United Kingdom

RQ0ZQ6RRTMT6F,"I cannot recommend this item under any circumstances. After waiting (quite a while) for the item to arrive, I plug in the batteries in turn. Thinking it strange that the charger is flashing red, not green, at this point I don't realise what this means. So, I charge the batteries. Then, after a few days I use the lawnmower. It works, but it is SO under-strength that it's laughable... like a child's toy. It mows for around 6 feet before conking out, and continues to fail (on short grass) every additional foot or so. I use the other (supposedly fully charged battery). It conks out in exactly the same way again.Anyway, either (1) the lawnmower is the worst piece of electrical equipment I've bought in 40 years - a child's toy lawnmower has more power. Or (2) the batteries are BOTH defective. Either way, that's pretty rubbish for equipment that cost over £200 to buy. My £80 Roche lawnmower is infinitely more powerful (and that's not great).On the plus side, it's not too heavy for me, and was easy to assemble.

I also find the fabric to be scratchy on the elbows and requires a hoodie or throw over the arms.Initially got this chair when I started working from home, to be a practical office chair to help my posture.

Additionally, the desk top was finally delivered.Original—Very disappointed—they seemed like a legit company, but I feel scammed.The company only shipped one half of the desk. When I never received the top half, I reached out and their customer service told me that they’d ensure that it was shipped immediately. But apparently that didn’t happen.After another 10 days without receiving the desk top, I contacted them again. They then told me that they never shipped the desk top and now it was sold out. Then they stopped responding to my questions.I decided to return the portion of the desk that I did received, but they made that process very difficult and expected me to pay for return shipping (it’s unclear if they were willing to reimburse me—I asked and got a very unhelpful response).Considering how expensive it would be to pay for return shipping on such a large and heavy item, it feels very risky to pay out of pocket and *hope* that FlexiSpot decides to behave professionally and reimburse me.

RUQI85NQHWP1M,"Overall Pros & Cons:Pros:1. Cheap.2. Installation tools provided.3, Easy to follow manual.4. Breathable mesh material.5. Cushioning on seat base & some cushioning on head support.6. You can sit on it & it won't break.Cons:1. Cheap feeling & construction.2. Arm-Wrest, seat & head support mesh material can be uncomfortable with direct-skin contact.3. Insufficient cushioning on arm wrest & head support.4. Unsatisfactory quality & adjustability of head-support & terrible adjustability of lower-back support.5. Chair creeks when the tilt pedal is pressed into the chair to lock it from tilting.First things first - This is a budget chair. It is not an impressive chair by any means, but it does the job. I purchased this to replace a ""gaming"" chair that had the metal back support bracket explode, resulting with the chair not having any back/leaning support (the chair would lean so far back, you'd fall off.Assembly - The chair comes with a picture-based, easy-to-follow manual & includes screws, spacers & an Alan key. You do not require any further tools other than what comes with the chair. You also don't need any experience to install the chair (it's that easy, just read the manual).Parts - The screws, spacers & Alan key parts were of a decent quality. No obvious defects or cheap-tool signs like non-centred bit hole on the screw. The screw holes of the chair & chair parts are larger than expected & some screw holes require spacers so the screw holds the parts together properly. My best guess it that the chair has some tolerance for manufacturing variance.Chair - The chair has a breathable mesh material for the back, which feels okay (your clothes layer over it, so it's not too bad.) The chair seat & arm-rest are made of the same mesh like cushioning material (different to the elastic mesh material that makes up the back of the chair. The arm-wrest has little-to-no cushioning to it & the mesh material can feel rough & uncomfortable sometimes, both on the chair & arm-wrest, especially when you wear short & a T-shirt & your legs & arms are rubbing against the material.The plastic construction of the chair looks cheap but the main structure of the chair doesn't seem to be unreasonably flimsy or bendy.The lumbar support is pretty terrible in my opinion - it has 2 ""clicks"" of adjustability & never feels comfortable in any position.The head-support is also pretty unsatisfactory - it's plastic construction looks & feels cheap & the stability of the head-support is pretty flimsy. Adjustability is slightly better than the lumbar support, but it is made of the similarly uncomfortable mesh as the arm-wrest & chair seat base & the head-support has a very flimsy vertical adjustability. It does, however, have a little bit of cushioning which makes it less terrible than the arm-wrest.The ""Tilt-resistance"" knob under the chair requires a lot of twisting in order to slightly adjust the resistance of the chair tilt. The chair makes some creaking noise when you try to tilt backwards with the tilt pedal pressed into the chair, so I personally prefer to keep the pedal pulled out so the chair can tilt freely.The pedal on the chair controls vertical lift of the gas lift (press the pedal up) as well as tilt of the chair (when pulled in/out of the chair). When the pedal allows for tilt, there is no adjustability or locking for how far the chair will tilt. It either tilts or it doesn't.To conclude, I've had this chair for about 2 weeks. So far there are no immediate defects or cracks/breaks that would make me go through the effort of sending the chair back. I am slightly annoyed, however. with the plastic screw hole covers as they tend to pop out after about every half week of using the chair.Would I recommend you buy this chair? If you have a very little budget & don't want to use a second hand chair or need a quick replacement chair that won't give you short term back & head pain, sure it will likely do the job. If you want a chair with consistent higher build quality with better back/head/lumbar support & tilt adjustability, I'd recommend you purchase a different chair.",3,2024-08-11,United Kingdom

RUS1LYSZ3A3K,"Do I like these small speakers? Sure, but there are some drawbacks.On my 16"" MBP M1max, you can hear constant clicking or static when there is no music playing.

It's plugged into the headphone jack for Audio and USB for power only, so maybe that has something to do with it.  If I plug the audio cables into my monitor, there is no clicking, but then I can't use the volume keys on my mac, and need to use the audio knob on the speaker.  Also, this setup only works with HDMI, not with Displayport setup.My other complaint is the cables.

It is heavier than I thought it would be but the strap helps.

RWRBP5MN7M6XY,I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He’s used it twice and now the battery doesn’t hold charge. We’ve left it charging over night and it still cuts off after a few seconds. How do we go about getting a replacement battery?,1,2023-05-17,United Kingdom
RWS9Z52E5M0DG,"It’s not lightweight, it just isn’t. After 30mins use you’ll ache all over, it’s super heavy at the cutting end and the long extension exaggerates the weight. It’s very cumbersome to move into position and use.Mine broke after a few uses. The cordless extension pole has small metal connectors which are very fragile and one snapped off, making it unusable.I’m not against Ryobi tools at all, but the design of this hedge trimmer is flawed.

RXLYYZPQI0F5H,"I bought this one because it advertised including the USB adapte--it did not.  My speakers blew out, and I need speakers for work.  Nothing fancy, just so I can hear zoom meetings or whatever. Ordered overnight because of the importance to get new speakers quickly. The speakers arrived packaged loose in a clear plastic bag about the size of a trash bag.  Fairly sure that indicates it was a return even though it is supposed to be a new item in box.Of coarse there was no adapter making it useless to me.  So what do you do?  Return it, amazon holds the extra money for weeks, gotta go stand in like at the fedex store to return it.  Go several more days waiting for replacements to arrive.  Or, go spend more money to buy what should have been included.  Well of coarse I just went and bought an adapter--that's what these companies count on.  It's a common scam now.  Sell you something worthless or not as advertised, but if the price is low it will be too much trouble for most people to deal with the return.The sound quality is cheap.  Its a typical trick you see in cheap speakers.  They amp up the bass output so people with unrefined ears think ""oh man it sounds so full.""  But really the bass is just drowning out the other sound frequencies.  Its annoying--trying to listen to people talk getting muddled up by unnecessary bass frequency.  And when the bass is overbearing, its impossible to turn the volume to a level where you can hear but the people in the next room can't.  The little bass boost switch on the bottom does nothing.  May it switches it from way too much bass to way WAY too much bass.I don't understand why it asks to rate the volume control.  Yeah, the volume control knob works.  Good for you.  You've successfully accomplished using 100 year old tech.  I'm guessing they only want that rated so it will juke the stats.Huge dissappointment.  Would not buy again.  Poor packaging has me rethinking Amazon in the future at all.  Real bent up rubber ducky--no lube.",1,2023-12-13,United States

RY9GAITHCTO3W,Machine works great but the parts like the handle and the pull handle are badly made. The handle just pushes in and is thin plastic in fact it's not even strong so when u try lift the handle pulls iut as it doesn't clip in properly its like it's too small for the machines slips in and out kf where it should clip in and due to this I've dropped the machine and dented plastic in casing. And the pull handle is the same which means when moving the machine around u have to pick it up and carry it as the wheels fall off when trying to push or pull. I wanted this machine so it was easy to move about as I'm disabled but the handles and wheels are of no use as too thin and flimsy or poorly fitted which considering the price isn't good at all I got this also because I thought this brand were meant to be good and well made when in fact the parts on my 6yr old unbranded machine are stronger so was disappointed whoever the machine itself works well but not as powerful as expected but all the same does the job it's made for. So can't say much more so think before buying and if ur wanting it to be easily koved around thjnk again and u will need to pick it up and carry it.,3,2022-03-04,United Kingdom

I took it in to my GP and had the nurse take my BP using this machine 198/100, then using her machine 158/90. This machine is completely inaccurate. I tried to return for a refund, Amazon arranged a collection via their livechat, only to receive an email from Royal Mail 1 minute later saying my collection had been cancelled as they don't collect from my address. I give up, it's going in the bin. If you do buy this, make sure you calibrate it with your GP to ensure it's accurate, maybe I just had a duff one.",1,2025-03-22,United Kingdom

RYJNSMQCXJSGY,"As with so many people now, I needed to create a 2nd home office due to my wife now also working from home. I ordered these after looking for a set of speakers for my new office setup. They seemed to have good reviews on both Amazon and Argos. I pretty much buy everything through Amazon so these were no different. I finally got round to sorting out a spare room and creating my new office space last week having ordered these speakers at the end of January. I plugged them in and it took a little while to realise but only 1 speaker is working properly. I have checked all the connections and settings but nothing. The right hand speaker barely even vibrates whilst the left speaker can be pushing out clear loud audio.I’m sure if both speakers are working they are great.However, the problem I have faced is unlike most products I can’t seem to do anything about these faulty items through Amazon. It just directs you to their website. I tried this but in order to contact the manufacturers you ‘have to’ enter an order number but it does not accept the Amazon order number so will not allow me to contact the company as it just throws back an error message.I wouldn’t recommend buying these through Amazon.

RYNXDS5ATZJGF,"Edit: Update. I was finally able to reach the seller via Amazon messaging and, after sending video and pics, they agreed to send me a new leg. It arrived 4 days later and works fine. So now I have a working desk. Review bumped to 3 stars because the split tabletop is a pain and will probably need to be replaced.So unfortunatley after an hour of assembly, one of the legs will not raise or lower. In my video you can see the rod turning and the mechanics inside the leg are being turned, but that leg will not raise. Tried to see if it was locked up, I was able to forcibly grab the top and pull up but it just slipped right back to the lower position without resistance. I tried calling the support number on the box multiple times. It rings 4x then goes to a busy signal. Packing this up to return is going to be a pain in the rear.Other cons. I got the kind with the TWO top boards ... why is that even a thing? The top board should be a single board. This forces us to screw into the bottom to pull the pieces together at the bracket and then the particle board just falls apart and it's impossible to get tight. The screws looses grip right away or over time. Boards become uneven... It's a mess.Side note, all the reviews of people saying the side bracjets that hold the top ""don't fit the top"", well they put them on wrong. They can go with the L shape out or in, you have to rotate them and put the L shape in to be under the top, then the screw holes line up.",3,2022-02-10,United States
